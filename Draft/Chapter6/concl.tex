\chapter{Conclusions and Future}

In this Chapter, we present our general conclusions. We discuss the limitations inherent
in our model, and speculate upon how we may address these weaknesses in the future.
We, furthermore, speculate upon the possible applications of our model to real plasmas.
We, finally, consider the physical questions still remaining â€“ concluding, ultimately, that a
considerable amount of work is still needed to answer these questions definitively.
