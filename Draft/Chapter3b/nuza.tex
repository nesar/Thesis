The CLASSIC approach is based on performing a prior linearization to the cosmological density field and later a cosmic web classification of the resulting matter distribution. The method is implemented in two steps: first, a linearization is made to better fulfil the mathematical conditions of the original idea of cosmic web classification, which is based on a linear Taylor expansion of the gravitational field \citep[see][]{1974FizSz..24..304Z,hahn2007a}, and then, cosmological structures are divided into voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The linearization is done using higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory as proposed by \cite{2012MNRAS.425.2443K}. In this framework, a given density field can be expressed as the sum of a linear and a non-linear component which are tightly coupled to each other by the tidal field tensor. The cosmic web classification is performed on a grid cell in a similar way as suggested by \cite{hahn2007a}, i.e. counting the number of eigenvalues of the Hessian of the gravitational potential above a given threshold \citep[see also][]{forero2009}. In particular, the threshold adopted was chosen to obtain a volume filling fraction (VFF) of voids of about $70\%$ as done by \cite{2014MNRAS.445..988N} for their reconstruction on the local universe based on peculiar velocity fields. As a result, the corresponding VFFs of sheets, filaments and knots are uniquely determined by this choice.
