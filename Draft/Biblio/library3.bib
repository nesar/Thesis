abstract = {This paper reviews and analyses methods used to identify neighbours in 6D space and estimate the corresponding phase-space density. It compares SPH methods to 6D Delaunay tessellation on statical and dynamical realisation of single halo profiles, paying attention to the unknown scaling, S{\_}G, used to relate the spatial dimensions to the velocity dimensions. The methods with local adaptive metric provide the best phase-space estimators. They make use of a Shannon entropy criterion combined with a binary tree partitioning and with SPH interpolation using 10-40 neighbours. Local scaling implemented by such methods, which enforces local isotropy of the distribution function, can vary by about one order of magnitude in different regions within the system. It presents a bimodal distribution, in which one component is dominated by the main part of the halo and the other one is dominated by the substructures. While potentially better than SPH techniques, since it yields an optimal estimate of the local softening volume (and the local number of neighbours required to perform the interpolation), the Delaunay tessellation in fact poorly estimates the phase-space distribution function. Indeed, it requires, the choice of a global scaling S{\_}G. We propose two methods to estimate S{\_}G that yield a good global compromise. However, the Delaunay interpolation still remains quite sensitive to local anisotropies in the distribution. We also compare 6D phase-space density estimation with the proxy, Q=rho/sigma{\^{}}3, where rho is the local density and 3 sigma{\^{}}2 is the local 3D velocity dispersion. We show that Q only corresponds to a rough approximation of the true phase-space density, and is not able to capture all the details of the distribution in phase-space, ignoring, in particular, filamentation and tidal streams.},

abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10{\{}{\%}{\}} in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold dark matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Omega b/ Omega 0 {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}{\{}{\~{}}{\}} Omega 0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter Gamma .},

Yet, little is known about the most effective construction and the characteristics of the underlying network. Here we explore seven network construction algorithms that use various galaxy properties, from their location, to their size and relative velocity, to assign a network to galaxy distributions provided by both simulations and observations. We find that a model relying only on spatial proximity offers the best correlations between the physical characteristics of the connected galaxies. We show that the properties of the networks generated from simulations and observations are identical, unveiling a deep universality of the cosmic web.},

abstract = {We introduce a multiscale topological description of the Megaparsec weblike cosmic matter distribution. Betti numbers and topological persistence offer a powerful means of describing the rich connectivity structure of the cosmic web and of its multiscale arrangement of matter and galaxies. Emanating from algebraic topology and Morse theory, Betti numbers and persistence diagrams represent an extension and deepening of the cosmologically familiar topological genus measure, and the related geometric Minkowski functionals. In addition to a description of the mathematical background, this study presents the computational procedure for computing Betti numbers and persistence diagrams for density field filtrations. The field may be computed starting from a discrete spatial distribution of galaxies or simulation particles. The main emphasis of this study concerns an extensive and systematic exploration of the imprint of different weblike morphologies and different levels of multiscale clustering in the corresponding computed Betti numbers and persistence diagrams. To this end, we use Voronoi clustering models as templates for a rich variety of weblike configurations, and the fractal-like Soneira-Peebles models exemplify a range of multiscale configurations. We have identified the clear imprint of cluster nodes, filaments, walls, and voids in persistence diagrams, along with that of the nested hierarchy of structures in multiscale point distributions. We conclude by outlining the potential of persistent topology for understanding the connectivity structure of the cosmic web, in large simulations of cosmic structure formation and in the challenging context of the observed galaxy distribution in large galaxy surveys.},

abstract = {Detecting layout hotspots is one of the key problems in phys-ical verification flow. Although machine learning solutions show benefits over lithography simulation and pattern match-ing based methods, it is still hard to select a proper model for large scale problems and it is inevitable that performance degradation will occur. To overcome these issues, in this pa-per we develop a deep learning framework for high perfor-mance and large scale hotspot detection. First, feature tensor generation is proposed to extract representative layout fea-tures that fit well with convolutional neural networks while keeping the spatial relationship of the original layout pattern with minimal information loss. Second, we propose a biased learning algorithm to train the convolutional neural network to further improve detection accuracy with small false alarm penalties. Experimental results show that our framework out-performs previous machine learning-based hotspot detectors in both the ICCAD 2012 Contest benchmarks and large scale industrial benchmarks.},

abstract = {We report results from simulations of neutralino dark matter ({\$}\backslashchi{\$}DM) haloes. We follow them from their emergence at one earth mass to a final mass of a few percent solar. We show that the density profiles of the first haloes are well described by a {\$}\backslashsim r{\^{}}{\{}-1.5{\}}{\$} power-law. As haloes grow in mass, their density profiles evolve significantly. In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on average {\$}\backslashsim r{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. However, the profile of individual haloes can show non-monotonic density slopes, and be shallower than {\$}-1{\$} in some cases. We investigate the transformation of cuspy power-law profiles using a series of non-cosmological simulations of equal-mass mergers. Contrary to previous findings, we observe that temporal variations in the gravitational potential caused by mergers lead to a shallowing of the inner profile, an effect which is stronger for shallower initial profiles and for mergers that involve a higher number of systems. Depending on the merger details, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their inner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the initial profile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of {\$}-1{\$} (such as NFW or Hernquist profiles). This offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of NFW-like profiles in {\$}\backslashchi{\$}DM simulations. After their initial collapse, {\$}\backslashchi{\$}DM haloes suffer copious major mergers, which progressively shallows the profile. However, once an NFW-like profile is established, it appears stable against subsequent merging. This suggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a combination of (1) the physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2) their early merger history, which are both set by the properties of the dark matter particle, as well as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to perturbations.},

@article{Vogelsberger2011,
abstract = {We present the first and so far the only simulations to follow the fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic $\Lambda$ cold dark matter initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these methods to the six Milky Way mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from the halo centre, a typical point intersects about 1014 streams with a very broad range of individual densities; the ˜106 most-massive streams contribute about half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most-massive fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1 per cent of the total signal. Dark matter particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the big bang, with a 5-95 per cent range of 50-500. Such caustic counts are a measure of the total amount of dynamical mixing and are very robustly determined by our technique. The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a negligible boost ({\textless}0.1 per cent) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate. The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10 per cent. Thus, fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the detectability of the dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories or indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most-massive local fine-grained streams because of their extreme localization in the energy-momentum space.},

Recent application of the Bayesian inference algorithm BORG to the SDSS Data Release 7 main galaxy sample has generated detailed Eulerian and Lagrangian representations of the large-scale structure as well as the possibility to accurately quantify corresponding uncertainties. Building upon these results, we present constrained catalogs of voids in the Sloan volume, aiming at a physical representation of dark matter underdensities and at the alleviation of the problems due to sparsity and biasing on galaxy void catalogs. To do so, we generate data-constrained reconstructions of the presently observed large-scale structure using a fully non-linear gravitational model. We then find and analyze void candidates using the VIDE toolkit. Our methodology therefore predicts the properties of voids based on fusing prior information from simulations and data constraints. For usual void statistics (number function, ellipticity distribution and radial density profile), all the results obtained are in agreement with dark matter simulations. Our dark matter void candidates probe a deeper void hierarchy than voids directly based on the observed galaxies alone. The use of our catalogs therefore opens the way to high-precision void cosmology at the level of the dark matter field. We will make the void catalogs used in this work available at http://www.cosmicvoids.net [http://www.cosmicvoids.net] .},

abstract = {We search for and find fossil evidence that the spin axes of galaxies in cosmic web filaments relative to their host filaments are not randomly distributed. This indicates the fact that the action of large-scale tidal torques affected the alignments of galaxies located in cosmic filaments. To this end, we constructed a catalogue of clean filaments containing edge-on galaxies. We started by applying the multiscale morphology filter technique to the galaxies in a redshift-distortion-corrected version of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5. From this sample, we extracted 426 filaments that contained edge-on galaxies (b/a {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.2). These filaments were then visually classified relative to a variety of quality criteria. These selected filaments contained 69 edge-on galaxies. Statistical analysis using `feature measures' indicates that the distribution of orientations of these edge-on galaxies relative to their parent filament deviates significantly from what would be expected on the basis of a random distribution of orientations. Fewer than 1 per cent of orientation histograms generated from simulated random distributions show the same features as observed in the data histogram. The interpretation of this result may not be immediately apparent, but it is easy to identify a population of 14 objects whose spin axes are aligned perpendicular to the spine of the parent filament (cos{\$}\theta{\$} {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.2). The candidate objects are found in relatively less dense filaments. This happens because galaxies in such locations suffer less interaction with surrounding galaxies and consequently better preserve their tidally induced orientations relative to the parent filament. These objects are also less intrinsically bright and smaller than their counterparts elsewhere in the filaments. The technique of searching for fossil evidence of alignment yields relatively few candidate objects, but it does not suffer from the dilution effects inherent in correlation analysis of large samples. The candidate objects could be the subjects of a programme of observations aimed at understanding in what way they might differ from their non-aligned counterparts.},

abstract = {We describe a new algorithm for finding substructures within dark matter haloes from N-body simulations. The algorithm relies upon the fact that dynamically distinct substructures in a halo will have a {\{}$\backslash$em local{\}} velocity distribution that differs significantly from the mean, i.e. smooth background halo. We characterize the large-scale mean field using a coarsely grained cell-based approach, while a kernel smoothing process is used to determined the local velocity distribution. Comparing the ratio of these two estimates allows us to identify particles which are strongly cluster in velocity space relative to the background and thus resident in substructure. From this population of outliers, groups are identified using a Friends-of-Friends-like approach. False positives are rejected using Poisson noise arguments. This approach does not require a search of the full phase-space structure of a halo, a non-trivial task, and is thus computationally advantageous. We apply our algorithm to several test cases and show that it identifies not only subhaloes, bound overdensities in phase-space, but can recover tidal streams with a high purity. Our method can even find streams which do not appear significantly overdense in either physical or phase-space.},

abstract = {Resolving numerically Vlasov-Poisson equations for initially cold systems can be reduced to following the evolution of a three-dimensional sheet evolving in six-dimensional phase-space. We describe a public parallel numerical algorithm consisting in representing the phase-space sheet with a conforming, self-adaptive simplicial tessellation of which the vertices follow the Lagrangian equations of motion. The algorithm is implemented both in six- and four-dimensional phase-space. Refinement of the tessellation mesh is performed using the bisection method and a local representation of the phase-space sheet at second order relying on additional tracers created when needed at runtime. In order to preserve in the best way the Hamiltonian nature of the system, refinement is anisotropic and constrained by measurements of local Poincar$\backslash$'e invariants. Resolution of Poisson equation is performed using the fast Fourier method on a regular rectangular grid, similarly to particle in cells codes. To compute the density projected onto this grid, the intersection of the tessellation and the grid is calculated using the method of Franklin and Kankanhalli (1993) generalised to linear order. As preliminary tests of the code, we study in four dimensional phase-space the evolution of an initially small patch in a chaotic potential and the cosmological collapse of a fluctuation composed of two sinusoidal waves. We also perform a "warm" dark matter simulation in six-dimensional phase-space that we use to check the parallel scaling of the code.},

abstract = {We describe a new method (HOP) for identifying groups of particles in N-body simulations. Having assigned to every particle an estimate of its local density, we associate each particle with the densest of the Nhop particles nearest to it. Repeating this process allows us to trace a path, within the particle set itself, from each particle in the direction of increasing density. The path ends when it reaches a particle that is its own densest neighbor; all particles reaching the same such particle are identified as a group. Combined with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straightforward. One can proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour. While the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen parameters, we show that the results are insensitive to most of these, the exception being the outer density cutoff of the groups.},

abstract = {Within the framework of the adiabatic scenario of galaxy formation, fully three-dimensional numerical simulations have been undertaken for the formation and evolution of the large scale structure of the universe. The model contains 32-squared (32,768) collisionless particles which only interact gravitationally. The evolution of perturbations is followed in an expanding cosmological model. The structure formation begins with pancakes, evolves to the network structure, then to the formation of clumps connected by strings, and finally to the formation of isolated clumps. Due to statistical initial perturbations, one can observe different phases of the process in different places simultaneously.

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

abstract = {We present a very large high-resolution cosmological N-body simulation, the Millennium-XXL or MXXL, which uses 303 billion particles to represent the formation of dark matter structures throughout a 4.1 Gpc box in a {\$}\Lambda{\$} cold dark matter cosmology. We create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clusters using surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxy surveys, X-ray luminosity, integrated Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal and lensing mass. The unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us to explore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with cluster mass. The scatter correlates between different mass-observable relations because of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation and environment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition of uncorrelated structure. We show that this can account for the apparent discrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal SZ signals measured for optically and X-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the Planck satellite. Related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clusters detected at high redshift. Our results illustrate that cosmological conclusions from galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only of the relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables and of the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures.},

Using the Fisher matrix formalism we find the error ellipses in the {\{}{\$}{\}}w{\{}{\_}{\}}0-w{\{}{\_}{\}}a{\{}{\$}{\}} plane when the equation of state of dark energy is assumed to be of the form {\{}{\$}{\}}w{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}CPL{\{}{\}}{\}}(z)=w{\{}{\_}{\}}0 +w{\{}{\_}{\}}a z/(1+z){\{}{\$}{\}}. We forecast the number of voids to be observed with the ESA Euclid satellite and the NASA WFIRST mission, taking into account updated details of the surveys to reach accurate estimates of their power. The theoretical model for the forecast of the number of voids is based on matches between abundances in simulations and the analytical prediction. To take into account the uncertainties within the model, we marginalize over its free parameters when calculating the Fisher matrices. The addition of the void abundance constraints to the data from Planck, HST and supernova survey data noticeably tighten the {\{}{\$}{\}}w{\{}{\_}{\}}0-w{\{}{\_}{\}}a{\{}{\$}{\}} parameter space. We thus quantify the improvement in the constraints due to the use of voids and demonstrate that the void abundance is a sensitive new probe for the dark energy equation of state.},

abstract = {A new multi-dimensional Hierarchical Structure Finder (HSF) to study the phase-space structure of dark matter in N-body cosmological simulations is presented. The algorithm depends mainly on two parameters, which control the level of connectivity of the detected structures and their significance compared to Poisson noise. By working in 6D phase-space, where contrasts are much more pronounced than in 3D position space, our HSF algorithm is capable of detecting subhaloes including their tidal tails, and can recognise other phase-space structures such as pure streams and candidate caustics. If an additional unbinding criterion is added, the algorithm can be used as a self-consistent halo and subhalo finder. As a test, we apply it to a large halo of the Millennium Simulation, where 19 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the halo mass are found to belong to bound substructures, which is more than what is detected with conventional 3D substructure finders, and an additional 23-36 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the total mass belongs to unbound HSF structures. The distribution of identified phase-space density peaks is clearly bimodal: high peaks are dominated by the bound structures and low peaks belong mostly to tidal streams. In order to better understand what HSF provides, we examine the time evolution of structures, based on the merger tree history. Bound structures typically make only up to 6 orbits inside the main halo. Still, HSF can identify at the present time at least 80 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the original content of structures with a redshift of infall as high as z {\{}{\textless}{\}}= 0.3, which illustrates the significant power of this tool to perform dynamical analyses in phase-space.},

abstract = {Warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies are a viable alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) scenario. Unfortunately, an accurate scrutiny of the WDM predictions with N-body simulations has proven difficult due to numerical artefacts. Here, we report on cosmological simulations that, for the first time, are devoid of those problems, and thus are able to accurately resolve the WDM halo mass function well below the cut-off. We discover a complex picture, with perturbations at different evolutionary stages populating different ranges in the halo mass function. On the smallest mass scales we can resolve, identified objects are typically centres of filaments that are starting to collapse. On intermediate mass scales, objects typically correspond to fluctuations that have collapsed and are in the process of relaxation, whereas the high-mass end is dominated by objects similar to haloes identified in CDM simulations. We then explicitly show how the formation of low-mass haloes is suppressed, which translates into a strong cut-off in the halo mass function. This disfavours some analytic formulations that predict a halo mass function that would extend well below the free streaming mass. We argue for a more detailed exploration of the formation of the smallest structures expected to form in a given cosmology, which, we foresee, will advance our overall understanding of structure formation.},

abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5×10 7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

Via observing the cosmic standard candles, this is one of the conventional ways to estimate peculiar velocities. However, at intermediate redshifts ({\{}{\$}{\}}z {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 0.5{\{}{\$}{\}}), deviations from the background FRW model are not uniquely governed by peculiar velocities. Luminosity distances are modified by gravitational lensing which affects the light trajectories. Hence using the conventional peculiar velocity method will result in an overestimate of the measured peculiar velocities at intermediate redshifts. Here we quantify this effect and show that although present data are still incapable of extracting any lensing effect on distance measurement and peculiar velocity estimation, this effect will however be significant for future large-scale structure surveys.},

abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}12 Msun, less than 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

Filaments are traced along the Hessian eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, and are stopped when the axis orientation changes more rapidly than a preset threshold. In both N-body simulations and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy redshift survey data, the resulting filament length distributions are approximately exponential. In the SDSS galaxy distribution, using smoothing lengths of 10 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 15 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc, we find filament lengths per unit volume of 1.9x10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} h{\^{}}2 Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} and 7.6x10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} h{\^{}}2 Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}, respectively. The filament width distributions, which are much more sensitive to non-linear growth, are also consistent between the real and mock galaxy distributions using a standard cosmology. In SDSS, we find mean filament widths of 5.5 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 8.4 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc on 10 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 15 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc smoothing scales, with standard deviations of 1.1 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 1.4 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc, respectively. Finally, the spatial distribution of filamentary structure in simulations is very similar between z=3 and z=0 on smoothing scales as large as 15 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc, suggesting that the outline of filamentary structure is already in place at high redshift.},

@article{Lapparent1986,
abstract = {A preliminary discussion is presented of recent results obtained as part of the extension of the Center of Astrophysics redshift survey. Several features of the results are striking. The distribution of galaxies in the sample, which contains 1100 galaxies in a 6 deg x 117 deg strip going through the Coma cluster, looks like a slice through the suds in the kitchen sink. It appears that the galaxies are on the surfaces of bubble-like structures with diameters of 25-50/h-Mpc. The largest bubble in the survey has a diameter comparable with the most recent estimates of the diameter of the void in Bootes. This topology poses serious challenges for current models for the formation of large-scale structure. The best available model for generating these structures is the explosive galaxy formation theory of Ostriker and Cowie (1981).},

Our model implies that the void ellipticity distribution depends sensitively on the cosmological parameters.

abstract = {We study evolution of voids in cosmological simulations using a new method for tracing voids over cosmic time. The method is based on tracking watershed basins (contiguous regions around density minima) of well developed voids at low redshift, on a regular grid of density field. It enables us to construct a robust and continuous mapping between voids at different redshifts, from initial conditions to the present time. We discuss how the new approach eliminates strong spurious effects of numerical origin when voids evolution is traced by matching voids between successive snapshots (by analogy to halo merger trees). We apply the new method to a cosmological simulation of a standard LambdaCDM cosmological model and study evolution of basic properties of typical voids (with effective radii between 6Mpc/h and 20Mpc/h at redshift z=0) such as volumes, shapes, matter density distributions and relative alignments. The final voids at low redshifts appear to retain a significant part of the configuration acquired in initial conditions. Shapes of voids evolve in a collective way which barely modifies the overall distribution of the axial ratios. The evolution appears to have a weak impact on mutual alignments of voids implying that the present state is in large part set up by the primordial density field. We present evolution of dark matter density profiles computed on iso-density surfaces which comply with the actual shapes of voids. Unlike spherical density profiles, this approach enables us to demonstrate development of theoretically predicted bucket-like shape of the final density profiles indicating a wide flat core and a sharp transition to high-density void walls.},

Performing a cosmological parameter analysis of current CMB and large scale structure data, we show that these power spectra give very accurate 1 and 2 dimensional parameter posteriors. We have extended Pico to allow computation of the tensor power spectrum and the matter transfer function. Pico runs about 1500 times faster than CAMB at the default accuracy and about 250,000 times faster at high accuracy. Training Pico can be done using massively parallel computing resources, including distributed computing projects such as Cosmology@Home.

abstract = {We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmic morphologies of the large-scale structure by examining the Lagrangian dynamics of various tensors of a cosmic fluid element, including the velocity gradient tensor, the Hessian matrix of the gravitational potential as well as the deformation tensor. Instead of the eigenvalue representation, the first two tensors, which associate with the "kinematic" and "dynamical" cosmic web classification algorithm respectively, are studied in a more convenient parameter space. These parameters are defined as the rotational invariant coefficients of the characteristic equation of the tensor. In the nonlinear local model (NLM) where the magnetic part of Weyl tensor vanishes, these invariants are fully capable of characterizing the dynamics. Unlike the Zeldovich approximation (ZA), where various morphologies do not change before approaching a one-dimensional singularity, the sheets in NLM are unstable for both overdense and underdense perturbations. While it has long been known that the coupling between tidal tensor and velocity shear would cause a filamentary final configuration of a collapsing region, we show that the underdense perturbation are more subtle, as the balance between the shear rate (tidal force) and the divergence (density) could lead to different morphologies. Interestingly, this instability also sets the basis for understanding some distinctions of the cosmic web identified dynamically and kinematically. We show that the sheets with negative density perturbation in the potential based algorithm would turn to filaments faster than in the kinematic method, which could explain the distorted dynamical filamentary structure observed in the simulation.},

abstract = {We combine data from a number of N-body simulations to predict the abundance of dark haloes in cold dark matter (CDM) universes over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10-30per cent at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our `Hubble volume' simulations of $\tau$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of `typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

abstract = {We track subhalo orbits of galaxy and group sized halos in cosmological simulations. We identify filamentary structures around halos and we use these to define a sample of subhalos accreted from filaments as well as a control sample of subhalos accreted from other directions. We use these samples to study differences in satellite orbits produced by filamentary accretion. Our results depend on host halo mass. We find that for low masses, subhalos accreted from filaments show {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashsim10\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\%}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} shorter lifetimes compared to the control sample, they show a tendency towards more radial orbits, reach halo central regions earlier, and are more likely to merge with the host. For higher mass halos this lifetime difference dissipates and even reverses for cluster sized halos. This behavior appears to be connected to the fact that more massive hosts are connected to stronger filaments with higher velocity coherence and density, with slightly more radial subhalo orbits. Because subhalos tend to follow the coherent flow of the filament, it is possible that such thick filaments are enough to shield the subhalo from the effect of dynamical friction at least during their first infall. We also identify subhalo pairs/clumps which merge with one another after accretion. They survive as a clump for only a very short time, which is even shorter for higher subhalo masses, suggesting that the Magellanic Clouds and other Local group satellite associations, may have entered the MW virial radius very recently and probably are in their first infall. Filaments boost the accretion of satellite associations.},

abstract = {Context: In the past decade or so, using numerical N-body simulations to describe the gravitational clustering of dark matter (DM) in an expanding universe has become the tool of choice for tackling the issue of hierarchical galaxy formation. As mass resolution increases with the power of supercomputers, one is able to grasp finer and finer details of this process, resolving more and more of the inner structure of collapsed objects. This begs one to revisit time and again the post-processing tools with which one transforms particles into ``invisible'' dark matter haloes and from thereon into luminous galaxies. Aims: Although a fair amount of work has been devoted to growing Monte-Carlo merger trees that resemble those built from an N-body simulation, comparatively little effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarily encounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation. To somewhat revert the tide, this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive study of the problems one faces when following this route. Methods: The first step in building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by the simulation. Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an algorithm (called AdaptaHOP) in this paper, we believe that our results do not depend on the exact details of the implementation but instead extend to most if not all (sub)structure finders. To illustrate this point in the appendix we compare AdaptaHOP's results to the standard friend-of-friend (FOF) algorithm, widely utilised in the astrophysical community. We then highlight different ways of building merger histories from AdaptaHOP haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their various advantages and drawbacks. Results: We find that the best approach to (sub)halo merging histories is through an analysis that goes back and forth between identification and tree building rather than one that conducts a straightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. This is rooted in the complexity of the merging trees that have to depict an inherently dynamical process from the partial temporal information contained in the collection of instantaneous snapshots available from the N-body simulation. However, we also propose a simpler sequential ``Most massive Substructure Method'' (MSM) whose trees approximate those obtained via the more complicated non sequential method.

abstract = {Splashback refers to the process of matter that is accreting onto a dark matter halo reaching its first orbital apocenter and turning around in its orbit. The cluster-centric radius at which this process occurs, r{\{}{\_}{\}}sp, defines a halo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster, in contrast with other common halo boundary definitions such as R{\{}{\_}{\}}200. A rapid decline in the matter density profile of the halo is expected near r{\{}{\_}{\}}sp. We measure the galaxy number density and weak lensing mass profiles around RedMapper galaxy clusters in the first year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean mass {\{}{\~{}}{\}}2.5 x 10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}14 solar masses, we find strong evidence of a splashback-like steepening of the galaxy density profile and measure r{\{}{\_}{\}}sp=1.16 +/- 0.08 Mpc/h, consistent with earlier SDSS measurements of More et al. (2016) and Baxter et al. (2017). Moreover, our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the existence of a splashback-like steepening of the matter profile of galaxy clusters. We measure r{\{}{\_}{\}}sp=1.28 +/- 0.18 Mpc/h from the weak lensing data, in good agreement with our galaxy density measurements. Applying our analysis to different cluster and galaxy samples, we find that consistent with LambdaCDM simulations, r{\{}{\_}{\}}sp scales with R{\{}{\_}{\}}200m and does not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3--0.6. We also find that potential systematic effects associated with the RedMapper algorithm may impact the location of r{\{}{\_}{\}}sp, in particular the choice of scale used to estimate cluster richness. We discuss progress needed to understand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from DES and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock catalogs and independent cluster samples.},

abstract = {Previous studies using numerical simulations have demonstrated that the shape of the cosmic web can be described by studying the Lagrangian displacement field. We extend these analyses, showing that it is now possible to perform a Lagrangian description of cosmic structure in the nearby Universe based on large-scale structure observations. Building upon recent Bayesian large-scale inference of initial conditions, we present a cosmographic analysis of the dark matter distribution and its evolution, referred to as the dark matter phase-space sheet, in the nearby universe as probed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey main galaxy sample. We consider its stretchings and foldings using a tetrahedral tessellation of the Lagrangian lattice. The method provides extremely accurate estimates of nearby density and velocity fields, even in regions of low galaxy density. It also measures the number of matter streams, and the deformation and parity reversals of fluid elements, which were previously thought inaccessible using observations. We illustrate the approach by showing the phasespace structure of known objects of the nearby Universe such as the Sloan Great Wall, the Coma cluster and the Bo¨otes void. We dissect cosmic structures into four distinct components (voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters), using the Lagrangian classifiers diva, origami, and a new scheme which we introduce and call lich. Because these classifiers use information other than the sheer local density, identified structures explicitly carry physical information about their formation history. Accessing the phase-space structure of dark matter in galaxy surveys opens the way for new confrontations of observational data and theoretical models. We have made our data products publicly available.},

abstract = {We study the effect of non-perturbative corrections, associated with the behavior of particles after shell crossing, on the matter power spectrum. We compare their amplitude with the perturbative terms that can be obtained within the fluid description of the system, to estimate the range of scales where such perturbative approaches are relevant. We use the simple Zeldovich dynamics as a benchmark, as it allows to compute at once the full nonlinear power spectrum as well as perturbative terms at all orders. Then, we introduce a "sticky model" that coincides with the Zeldovich dynamics before shell crossing but shows a different behavior afterwards. Thus, their power spectra only differ through non-perturbative terms. We consider both the real-space and redshift-space power spectra. We find that for a LambdaCDM cosmology the potential of perturbative schemes is greater at higher redshift. For the real-space power spectrum, one can go up to the order 66 of perturbation theory at z=3, and to order 9 at z=0, before the non-perturbative correction becomes larger than the perturbative correction of that order. This allows to increase the upper bound on k where systematic theoretical predictions may be obtained by perturbative schemes, beyond the linear regime, by a factor {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashsim 26{\{}{\$}{\}} at z=3 and {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashsim 6.5{\{}{\$}{\}} at z=0. This provides a strong motivation to study perturbative resummation schemes, especially at high redshifts {\{}{\$}{\}}z \backslashbackslashgeq 1{\{}{\$}{\}}. We also point out that the rise of the power spectrum at the transition scale to the nonlinear regime strongly depends on the behavior of the system after shell crossing. We find similar results for the redshift-space power spectrum, with characteristic wavenumbers that are shifted to lower values as redshift-space distortions amplify higher-order terms of the perturbative expansions while decreasing the resummed nonlinear power at high k.},

abstract = {The skeleton formalism, which aims at extracting and quantifying the filamentary structure of our Universe, is generalized to 3D density fields. A numerical method for computing a local approximation of the skeleton is presented and validated here on Gaussian random fields. It involves solving equation , where ∇$\rho$ and are the gradient and Hessian matrix of the field. This method traces well the filamentary structure in 3D fields such as those produced by numerical simulations of the dark matter distribution on large scales, and is insensitive to monotonic biasing. Two of its characteristics, namely its length and differential length, are analysed for Gaussian random fields. Its differential length per unit normalized density contrast scales like the probability distribution function of the underlying density contrast times the total length times a quadratic Edgeworth correction involving the square of the spectral parameter. The total length-scales like the inverse square smoothing length, with a scaling factor given by 0.21 (5.28 + n) where n is the power index of the underlying field. This dependency implies that the total length can be used to constrain the shape of the underlying power spectrum, hence the cosmology. Possible applications of the skeleton to galaxy formation and cosmology are discussed. As an illustration, the orientation of the spin of dark haloes and the orientation of the flow near the skeleton is computed for cosmological dark matter simulations. The flow is laminar along the filaments, while spins of dark haloes within 500 kpc of the skeleton are preferentially orthogonal to the direction of the flow at a level of 25 per cent.},

We test our prediction by comparing with voids identified in the dark matter density field in N-body simulations using the ZOBOV void finder. This tests the extent to which the spherical evolution approximation, which forms the basis of the analytical predictions, models the highly aspherical voids that occur in the cosmic web, and are found by a watershed-based algorithm such as ZOBOV. We show that the volume function returned by ZOBOV is quite sensitive to the choice of treatment of sub-voids, a fact that has not been appreciated previously. For reasonable choices of sub-void exclusion, we find that the Lagrangian density deltav of the ZOBOV voids -- which is predicted to be a constant deltav=-2.7 in the spherical evolution model -- is quite different from the predicted value, showing substantial scatter and scale dependence. Our analytical approximations are flexible enough to give a good description of the resulting volume function; however, this happens for choices of parameter values that are different from those suggested by the spherical evolution assumption. We conclude that analytical models for voids must move away from the spherical approximation in order to be applied successfully to observations, and we discuss some possible ways forward.},

Here we demonstrate that an ensemble of monopoles forms a plasma whose properties are well determined and whose collective effects place new tight constraints on the cosmological abundance of monopoles. In particular, the existence of micro-Gauss magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and radio relics implies that the scales of these structures are below the Debye screening length, thus setting an upper limit on the cosmological density parameter of monopoles, {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashOmega{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}M\backslashbackslashlesssim3\backslashbackslashtimes10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-4{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}, which precludes them from being the dark matter.

abstract = {Galaxies form in hierarchically assembling dark matter halos. With cosmological three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore in detail the virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with virial temperatures of 104 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that radius. With cooling, the virial shock position shrinks, and the filaments reach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures in protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of 2 from the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos, the gas reaches virial equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 3 in the cooling cases. This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and, interestingly, remains supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies, even in the absence of any feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3 orders of magnitude in length scale, with the turbulent pressure prevailing over the thermal energy. The turbulent velocity distributions are Maxwellian and by far dominate the small rotation velocities associated with the total angular momentum of the galaxies. Decomposing the velocity field using the Cauchy-Stokes theorem, we show that ample amounts of vorticity are present around shocks even at the very centers of these objects. In the cold flow regime of galaxy formation for halo masses below 1012 Msolar, this dominant role of virialization-driven turbulence should play an important role in star formation, as well as the build up of early magnetic fields.},

abstract = {We present the Cosmic Web Detachment (CWD) model, a conceptual framework to interpret galaxy evolution in a cosmological context, providing a direct link between the star formation history of galaxies and the cosmic web. The CWD model unifies several mechanism known to disrupt or stop star formation into one single physical process and provides a natural explanation for a wide range of galaxy properties. Galaxies begin accreting star-forming gas at early times via a network of primordial highly coherent filaments. The efficient star formation phase ends when non-linear interactions with other galaxies or elements of the cosmic web detach the galaxy from its network of primordial filaments, thus ending the efficient accretion of cold gas. The stripping of the filamentary web around galaxies is the physical process responsible of star formation quenching in gas stripping, harassment, strangulation and starvation. Being a purely gravitational/mechanical process CWD acts at a more fundamental level than internal feedback processes. We introduce a simple and efficient formalism to identify CWD events in N-body simulations. With it we reproduce and explain, in the context of CWD, several key observations including downsizing, the cosmic star formation rate history, the galaxy mass-color diagram and the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies with mass and local density.},

Unfortunately, there is a lack of accurate theoretical predictions for the lensing signal of substructures, mainly because of the discreteness noise inherent to N-body simulations. Here we present Recursive-TCM, a method that is able to provide lensing predictions with an arbitrarily low discreteness noise, without any free parameters or smoothing scale. This solution is based on a novel way of interpreting the results of N-body simulations, where particles simply trace the evolution and distortion of Lagrangian phase-space volume elements. We discuss the advantages of this method over the widely used cloud-in-cells and adaptive-kernel smoothing density estimators. Applying the new method to a cluster-sized DM halo simulated in warm and cold DM scenarios, we show how the expected differences in their substructure population translate into differences in the convergence and magnification maps. We anticipate that our method will provide the high-precision theoretical predictions required to interpret and fully exploit strong gravitational lensing observations.},

The secondary infall approaches a self-similar form, with the exact behavior depending on the kind of gas and on central boundary conditions.

If there is no central black hole, a rho {\$}\backslash{\$}propto r{\{}{\^{}}{\}}-2.25 density profile results, with infalling matter added to successively larger radii. Solutions are given here for collisional, collisionless, and mixed gases. The collisional component, if present, accretes through an outwardly propagating shock, with fluid elements coming to rest a finite distance from the center if the adiabatic exponent gamma{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}4/3; softer equations of state may lead to black hole formation. The collisionless gas passes through the center and crosses itself, leading to the formation of outwardly propagating caustics.

abstract = {While various codes exist to systematically and robustly find haloes and subhaloes in cosmological simulations, this is the first work to introduce and rigorously test codes that find tidal debris (streams and other unbound substructure) in fully cosmological simulations of structure formation. We use one tracking and three non-tracking codes to identify substructure (bound and unbound) in a Milky Way type simulation from the Aquarius suite and post-process their output with a common pipeline to determine the properties of these substructures in a uniform way. By using output from a fully cosmological simulation, we also take a step beyond previous studies of tidal debris that have used simple toy models. We find that both tracking and non-tracking codes agree well on the identification of subhaloes and more importantly, the unbound tidal features associated with them. The distributions of basic properties of the total substructure distribution (mass, velocity dispersion, position) are recovered with a scatter of ˜20 per cent. Using the tracking code as our reference, we show that the non-tracking codes identify complex tidal debris with purities of ˜40 per cent. Analysing the results of the substructure finders, we find that the general distribution of substructures differ significantly from the distribution of bound subhaloes. Most importantly, both bound and unbound substructures together constitute ˜18 per cent of the host halo mass, which is a factor of ˜2 higher than the fraction in self-bound subhaloes. However, this result is restricted by the remaining challenge to cleanly define when an unbound structure has become part of the host halo. Nevertheless, the more general substructure distribution provides a more complete picture of a halo's accretion history.},

It is based on a watershed technique and uses a probability propagation scheme to improve the quality of the segmentation by circumventing the discreteness of the sampling. It can be applied within spaces of arbitrary dimensions and geometry. This recursive segmentation of space yields, for a {\{}{\$}{\}}d{\{}{\$}{\}}-dimensional space, a {\{}{\$}{\}}d-1{\{}{\$}{\}} succession of {\{}{\$}{\}}n{\{}{\$}{\}}-dimensional subspaces that fully characterize the topology of the density field. The final 1D manifold of the hierarchy is the fully connected network of the primary critical lines of the field : the skeleton. It corresponds to the subset of lines linking maxima to saddle points, and provides a definition of the filaments that compose the cosmic web as a precise physical object, which makes it possible to compute any of its properties such as its length, curvature, connectivity etc... When the skeleton extraction is applied to initial conditions of cosmological N-body simulations and their present day non linear counterparts, it is shown that the time evolution of the cosmic web, as traced by the skeleton, is well accounted for by the Zel'dovich approximation. Comparing this skeleton to the initial skeleton undergoing the Zel'dovich mapping shows that two effects are competing during the formation of the cosmic web: a general dilation of the larger filaments that is captured by a simple deformation of the skeleton of the initial conditions on the one hand, and the shrinking, fusion and disappearance of the more numerous smaller filaments on the other hand. Other applications of the N dimensional skeleton and its peak patch hierarchy are discussed.},

Using the presently largest spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), we study the connection between the spin axes of galaxies and the orientation of their host filaments. We use a 3D field of orientations to describe cosmic filaments. To restore the inclination angles of galaxies, we use a 3D photometric model of galaxies that gives these angles more accurately than traditional 2D models. We found evidence that the spin axes of bright spiral galaxies have a weak tendency to be aligned parallel to filaments. For elliptical/S0 galaxies, we have a statistically significant result that their spin axes are aligned preferentially perpendicular to the host filaments; we show that this signal practically does not depend on the accuracy of the estimated inclination angles for elliptical/S0 galaxies.},

abstract = {Dark matter numerical simulations and the N-body method are essential for understanding how structure forms and evolves in the Universe. However, the discrete nature of N-body simulations can affect its accuracy when modelling collisionless systems. We introduce a new approach to simulate the gravitational evolution of cold collisionless fluids by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in terms of adaptively refineable "Lagrangian phase space elements". These geometrical elements are piecewise smooth maps between three-dimensional Lagrangian space and six-dimensional Eulerian phase space and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function. They allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to follow the evolution even in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss various test problems which demonstrate the correctness and performance of our method. We show that it has several advantages compared to standard N-body algorithms by i) explicitly tracking the fine-grained distribution function, ii) naturally representing caustics, iii) providing an arbitrarily regular density field defined everywhere in space, iv) giving a smooth and regular gravitational potential field, thus eliminating the need for any type of ad-hoc force softening. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of using our method for cosmological studies by simulating structure formation in a warm dark matter cosmology. We show that spurious collisionality and discreteness noise of N-body methods are both strongly suppressed, which eliminates artificial fragmentation of filaments while providing access to the full deterministic evolution of the fluid in phase space. Therefore, we argue that our new approach improves on the N-body method when simulating self-gravitating cold and collisionless fluids, and is the first method that allows to explicitly follow the fine-grained evolution in six-dimensional phase space.},

abstract = {We analyze the structure and connectivity of the distinct morphologies that define the Cosmic Web. With the help of our Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF), we dissect the matter distribution of a cosmological {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM N-body computer simulation into cluster, filaments and walls. The MMF is ideally suited to adress both the anisotropic morphological character of filaments and sheets, as well as the multiscale nature of the hierarchically evolved cosmic matter distribution. The results of our study may be summarized as follows: i).- While all morphologies occupy a roughly well defined range in density, this alone is not sufficient to differentiate between them given their overlap. Environment defined only in terms of density fails to incorporate the intrinsic dynamics of each morphology. This plays an important role in both linear and non linear interactions between haloes. ii).- Most of the mass in the Universe is concentrated in filaments, narrowly followed by clusters. In terms of volume, clusters only represent a minute fraction, and filaments not more than 9{\%}. Walls are relatively inconspicous in terms of mass and volume. iii).- On average, massive clusters are connected to more filaments than low mass clusters. Clusters with {\$}M \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} h{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} have on average two connecting filaments, while clusters with {\$}M \backslashgeq 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} h{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} have on average five connecting filaments. iv).- Density profiles indicate that the typical width of filaments is 2{\$}\backslashMpch{\$}.

abstract = {Radiation pressure (RP; or photon momentum absorbed by gas) is important in a tremendous range of astrophysical systems. But we show the usual method for assigning absorbed photon momentum to gas in numerical radiation-hydrodynamics simulations (simply integrating over cell volumes or evaluating at cell/particle centers) can severely under-estimate the correct RP force around sources, unless photon mean-free-paths are highly-resolved in the fluid grid. The existence of this error is independent of the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact ray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods), because it depends on how the RT solution is interpolated back onto fluid elements. Brute-force convergence (resolving mean-free paths) is impossible in many cases (especially where high-opacity UV/ionizing photons are involved). Instead, we show a 'face-integrated' method -- integrating and applying the momentum fluxes at interfaces between fluid elements -- reproduces the correct solution at all resolution levels. The 'fix' is simple and we provide example implementations for ray-tracing, Monte-Carlo, and moments RT methods in both grid and mesh-free fluid schemes. We consider an example problem of star formation in a molecular cloud with single-scattering UV/ionizing RP. At state-of-the-art resolution, cell-integrated methods under-estimate the effects of RP by an order of magnitude, leading (incorrectly) to the conclusion that RP is unimportant, while face-integrated methods predict strong self-regulation of star formation and rapid cloud destruction via RP.},

abstract = {The volume of data that will be produced by new-generation surveys requires automatic classification methods to select and analyze sources. Indeed, this is the case for the search for strong gravitational lenses, where the population of the detectable lensed sources is only a very small fraction of the full source population. In this paper, we present a morphological classification method for recognizing strong gravitational lenses. The method, based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is applied to {\$}255{\$} square degrees of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), one of the current-generation optical wide surveys conducted with the VLT survey telescope (VST). The current CNN is optimized to recognize lenses with Einstein radii {\$}{\textgreater} 1.4{\$} arcsec, about twice the {\$}r{\$}-band seeing in KiDS. We construct a sample of {\$}21789{\$} color-magnitude selected Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) of which three are known lenses. From this sample the CNN retrieves 761 strong-lens candidates and correctly classifies two out of three of the known lenses. The misclassified lens has an Einstein radius well below the range on which the algorithm is trained. We down-select the most reliable 56 candidates by a joint visual inspection. This final sample is presented and discussed. A consistency check on the estimated Einstein radii of the final sample of candidates suggests that it is likely composed of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}22 reliable lenses. A result consistent with what is expected from lens-statistics simulations, when applying our color-magnitude and Einstein-radius cuts. A conservative estimate based on our results shows that with our proposed method it should be possible to find {\$}\backslashsim100{\$} massive LRG-galaxy lenses at {\$}z{\textless} 0.4{\$} in KiDS when completed. In the most optimistic scenario this number can grow considerably (to maximally {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2400 lenses). [Abridged]},

The results obtained demonstrate that the two clusters are embedded in a common supercluster of very large extent. It is found that there are three observationally distinct populations of galaxies within this supercluster, including galaxies located in the two rich cluster cores, those located in intermediate- or low-mass clusters, and a nearly homogeneously distributed population of isolated galaxies; in addition, a population of foreground galaxies located in low-mass clusters rather than being distributed in a homogeneous 'field' is also identified. The redshift of formation for the foreground groups is estimated to be no more than about 9, and the morphology of the galaxies is examined. It is suggested that every nearby very rich cluster is located in a supercluster and that all clusters of richness class greater than or equal to 2 will eventually be found to lie in superclusters.},

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for identifying ellipsoidal haloes in numerical simulations, and quantify how the resulting estimates of halo mass and shape differ with respect to spherical halo finders. Haloes become more prolate when fit with ellipsoids, the difference being most pronounced for the more aspherical objects. Although the ellipsoidal mass is systematically larger, this is less than 10 per cent for most of the haloes. However, even this small difference in mass corresponds to a significant difference in shape. We quantify these effects also on the initial mass and deformation tensors, on which most models of triaxial collapse are based. By studying the properties of protohaloes in the initial conditions, we find that models in which protohaloes are identified in Lagrangian space by three positive eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are tenable only at the masses well above M*. The overdensity {\$}\delta{\$} within almost any protohalo is larger than the critical value associated with spherical collapse (increasing as mass decreases); this is in good qualitative agreement with models which identify haloes requiring that collapse has occurred along all three principal axes, each axis having turned around from the universal expansion at a different time. The distributions of initial values are in agreement with the simplest predictions associated with ellipsoidal collapse, assuming initially spherical protohaloes, collapsed around random positions which were sufficiently overdense. However, most protohaloes are not spherical and departures from sphericity increase as protohalo mass decreases. The mass and deformation tensors are well aligned, in agreement with the fundamental assumption of ellipsoidal collapse, and with models which identify haloes with peaks in the initial density fluctuation field. But the direction of maximum initial compression coincides with the direction of what is initially the longest axis, contrary to what the peaks model predicts. By the final time, it is the shortest axis of the final object which tends to be aligned with the direction of initial maximal compression: the alignment changes during the evolution.},

abstract = {We study dynamical mass measurements of galaxy clusters contaminated by interlopers and show that a modern machine learning algorithm can predict masses by better than a factor of two compared to a standard scaling relation approach. We create two mock catalogs from Multidark's publicly available N-body MDPL1 simulation, one with perfect galaxy cluster membership information and the other where a simple cylindrical cut around the cluster center allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard approach, we use a power-law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. Assuming perfect membership knowledge, this unrealistic case produces a wide fractional mass error distribution, with awidth of  D » 0.87. Interlopers introduce additional scatter, significantly widening the error distribution further ( D » 2.13). We employ the support distribution machine (SDM) class of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single values. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and projected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a factor-of-two improvement ( D » 0.67) for the contaminated case. Remarkably, SDM applied to contaminated clusters is better able to recover masses than even the scaling relation approach applied to uncontaminated clusters. We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces the cluster mass function, making it a valuable tool for employing cluster observations to evaluate cosmological models.},

abstract = {We present DisPerSE, a novel approach to the coherent multi-scale identification of all types of astrophysical structures, and in particular the filaments, in the large scale distribution of matter in the Universe. This method and corresponding piece of software allows a genuinely scale free and parameter free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the DTFE density computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing of the density field is required. The idea is based on recent advances in distinct sub-domains of computational topology, which allows a rigorous application of topological principles to astrophysical data sets, taking into account uncertainties and Poisson noise. Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of robustness with respect to noise (defined as a "number of sigmas") and the algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters, filaments, walls and voids; filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling along the edges of walls bounding the voids. The method is also interesting as it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics, without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale. In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D simulated and observed data sets to the companion paper.},

abstract = {A new numerical technique to identify the cosmic web is proposed. It is based on locating multi-stream flows, i.e. the places where the velocity field is multi-valued. The method is local in Eulerian space, simple and computaionally efficient. This technique uses the velocities of particles and thus takes into account the dynamical information. This is in contrast with the majority of standard methods that use the coordinates of particles only. Two quantities are computed in every mesh cell: the mean and variance of the velocity field. In the cells where the velocity is single-valued the variance must be equal to zero exactly, therefore the cells with non-zero variance are identified as multi-stream flows. The technique has been tested in a N-body simulation of the $\backslash$L CDM model. The preliminary analysis has shown that numerical noise does not pose a significant problem. The web identified by the new method has been compared with the web identified by the standard technique using only the particle coordinates. The comparison has shown overall similarity of two webs as expected, however they by no means are identical. For example, the isocontours of the corresponding fields have significantly different shapes and some density peaks of similar heights exhibit significant differences in the velocity variance and vice versa. This suggest that the density and velocity variance have a significant degree of independence. The shape of the two-dimensional pdf of density and velocity variance confirms this proposition. Thus, we conclude that the dynamical information probed by this technique introduces an additional dimension into analysis of the web.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying the substructure within simulated dark matter haloes. The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et al. (2004) and Giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group of self-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of the host halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite). However, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellite haloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise to sub-subhaloes, etc. Our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels of this hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of all substructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). On average, haloes which formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure and to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide quantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very different from that of Gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo mass function per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. This universality extends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a given mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and substructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple parametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo masses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which should be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo substructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. Finally, we discuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise from different definitions of (host) halo mass.},

abstract = {Although coherent large-scale structures such as filaments and walls are apparent to the eye in galaxy redshift surveys, they have so far proven difficult to characterize with computer algorithms. This paper presents a procedure that uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of the galaxy density field to characterize the morphology of large-scale structure. By analysing the smoothed density field and its Hessian matrix, we can determine the types of structure - walls, filaments, or clumps - that dominate the large-scale distribution of galaxies as a function of scale. We have run the algorithm on mock galaxy distributions in a LCDM cosmological N-body simulation and the observed galaxy distributions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The morphology of structure is similar between the two catalogues, both being filament-dominated on 10-20 h -1 Mpc smoothing scales and clump-dominated on 5 h -1 Mpc scales. There is evidence for walls in both distributions, but walls are not the dominant structures on scales smaller than {\~{}}25 h -1 Mpc. Analysis of the simulation suggests that, on a given comoving smoothing scale, structures evolve with time from walls to filaments to clumps, where those found on smaller smoothing scales are further in this progression at a given time.},

@article{Sheth2001,
abstract = {The Press-Schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, $\delta$sc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that $\delta$sc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this $\delta$ec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.},

abstract = {We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological "zoom-in" simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first (1LPT) or second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves RMS relative errors of order 10{\^{}}(-4) for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real space based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.},

This paper discusses Marcus's concerns and some others, together with solutions to several of these problems provided by the "P theory of intelligence" and its realisation in the "SP computer model". The main advantages of the SP system are: relatively small requirements for data and the ability to learn from a single experience; the ability to model both hierarchical and non-hierarchical structures; strengths in several kinds of reasoning, including `commonsense' reasoning; transparency in the representation of knowledge, and the provision of an audit trail for all processing; the likelihood that the SP system could not be fooled into bizarre or eccentric recognition of stimuli, as deep learning systems can be; the SP system provides a robust solution to the problem of `catastrophic forgetting' in deep learning systems; the SP system provides a theoretically-coherent solution to the problems of correcting over- and under-generalisations in learning, and learning correct structures despite errors in data; unlike most research on deep learning, the SP programme of research draws extensively on research on human learning, perception, and cognition; and the SP programme of research has an overarching theory, supported by evidence, something that is largely missing from research on deep learning. In general, the SP system provides a much firmer foundation than deep learning for the development of artificial general intelligence.},

abstract = {The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations of cosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we summarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": we investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak value of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes stems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent -- the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.},

abstract = {We introduce a new code based on the merger hierarchy of dark matter halos to find and trace dark matter subhalos in simulations. Here dark matter subhalos are defined as self-bound remnant of dark matter halos. We keep full record of the merger hierarchy of subhalos and allow growth of satellite subhalos through accretion from its subordinate subhalos in the merger hierarchy hence allowing mergers among satellites. Local accretion of background mass is omitted while re-accretion of stripped mass is allowed. The justification of these treatments is provided by case study of the life of individual subhalos and by the success in finding the complete subhalo catalogue. Dependence of the result of this tracing algorithm on the time resolution of simulation output has also been examined. We compare our result to the popular subhalo finder SUBFIND and show that this Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code is able to well resolve subhalos in high density environment and keep strict physical track of subhalos' merger history. HBT also features fast speed as it does not need density interpolation or spatial searching when constructing source subhalos, and because it is fully parallelized. This code is available upon request with the author.},

abstract = {A model of the gravitationally evolved dark matter distribution, in the Eulerian space, is developed. It is a simple extension of the excursion set model that is commonly used to estimate the mass function of collapsed dark matter haloes. In addition to describing the evolution of the dark matter itself, the model allows one to describe the evolution of the Eulerian space distribution of the haloes. It can also be used to describe density profiles, on scales larger than the virial radius, of these haloes, and to quantify the way in which matter flows in and out of Eulerian cells. When the initial Lagrangian space distribution is white noise Gaussian, the model suggests that the Inverse Gaussian distribution should provide a reasonably good approximation to the evolved Eulerian density field, in agreement with numerical simulations. Application of this model to clustering from more general Gaussian initial conditions is discussed at the end.},

Recently, a few new models that explored the influence of anisotropic collapse on the shape of the mass function have been suggested. I discuss in more detail a particular model that assumes a fluid particle becomes part of a gravitationally bound halo when the smallest eigenvalue of the deformation tensor of the filtered initial density field reaches a certain threshold (like the filtered density contrast reaches the threshold in the Press-Schechter formalism). Choosing the smallest eigenvalue guarantees that the fluid particle in question experiences collapse along all three axes.

Theoretical background, advantages and disadvantages of the method are described. Possible modifications required to allow the method to detect structures of different character (airway tree) are mentioned. An implementation of the method was tested on synthetic images containing airway-like structures as well as on real medical images from chest CT scan.

abstract = {Understanding of the observed structure in the universe can be reached only in the theoretical framework of dark matter. N-body simulations are indispensable for the analysis of the formation and evolution of the dark matter web. Two primary fields - density and velocity fields - are used in most of studies. However dark matter provides two additional fields which are unique for collisionless media only. These are the multi- stream field in Eulerian space and flip-flop field in Lagrangian space. The flip-flop field represents the number of sign reversals of an elementary volume of each collisionless fluid element. This field can be estimated by counting the sign reversals of the Jacobian at each particle at every time step of the simulation. The Jacobian is evaluated by numerical differentiation of the Lagrangian submanifold, i.e., the three-dimensional dark matter sheet in the six-dimensional space formed by three Lagrangian and three Eulerian coordinates. We present the results of the statistical study of the evolution of the flip-flop field from z = 50 to the present time z = 0. A number of statistical characteristics show that the pattern of the flip-flop field remains remarkably stable from z = 30 to the present time. As a result the flip-flop field evaluated at z = 0 stores a wealth of information about the dynamical history of the dark matter web. In particular one of the most intriguing properties of the flip-flop is a unique capability to preserve the information about the merging history of dark matter haloes.},

abstract = {The massive galaxies in the young universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids (Genzel et al. 2006, 2008). Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes (Dekel {\&} Birnboim 2006; Keres et al. 2005). A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid (Noguchi 1999; Genzel et al. 2008, Elmegreen, Bournaud {\&} Elmegreen 2008, Dekel, Sari {\&} Ceverino 2009). This stream-driven scenario for the formation of disks and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

abstract = {On megaparsec scales the Universe is permeated by an intricate filigree of clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, the Cosmic Web. For the understanding of its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is that of the dominant underdense Voids, the product of a hierarchical process driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones. In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the Watershed Void Finder (WVF), is based upon the Watershed Transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling noise. This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on a set of Kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low noise and high noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the voids are succesfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void size distribution function.},

The morphology of the large scale structure, on the other hand, is an important property of the galaxy distribution. Here we apply an object point process with interactions (the Bisous model) to trace and extract the filamentary network in the presently largest galaxy redshift survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We search for filaments in the galaxy distribution that have a radius of about 0.5 Mpc/h. We divide the detected network into single filaments and present a public catalogue of filaments. We study the filament length distribution and show that the longest filaments reach the length of 60 Mpc/h.

abstract = {Dark matter haloes in cosmological filaments and walls have their spin vector aligned (in average) with their host structure. While haloes in walls are aligned with the plane of the wall independently of their mass, haloes in filaments present a mass dependent two-regime orientation. Here we show that the transition mass determining the change in the alignment regime (from parallel to perpendicular) depends on the hierarchical level in which the halo is located, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the Cosmic Web. By explicitly exposing this hierarchy we are able to identify the contributions of different components of the filament network to the spin alignment signal. We discuss a unifying picture to describe the alignment of haloes in filaments and walls consistent with previous results and our findings based on a two-phase angular momentum acquisition, first via tidal torquening and later via anisotropic mass accretion. The hierarchical identification and characterization of cosmic structures was done with a new implementation of the Multiscale Morphology Filter. The MMF-2 (introduced here) represents a significant improvement over its predecessor in terms of robustness and by explicitly describing the hierarchical relations between the elements of the Cosmic Web.},

abstract = {A deep fully-connected neural network with an i.i.d. prior over its parameters is equivalent to a Gaussian process (GP) in the limit of infinite network width. This correspondence enables exact Bayesian inference for neural networks on regression tasks by means of straightforward matrix computations. For single hidden-layer networks, the covariance function of this GP has long been known. Recently, kernel functions for multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a Bayesian framework. As such, previous work has not identified the correspondence between using these kernels as the covariance function for a GP and performing fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. In this work, we derive this correspondence and develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance functions. We then use the resulting GP to perform Bayesian inference for deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We find that the GP-based predictions are competitive and can outperform neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent. We observe that the trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding GP-based computation with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is strongly correlated with prediction error. We connect our observations to the recent development of signal propagation in random neural networks.},

abstract = {We report here the first systematic study of the supercluster-void network in the LCDM concordance cosmology in which voids and superclusters are treated on an equal footing. Superclusters are defined as individual members of an over-dense excursion set and voids are defined as individual members of a complementary under-dense excursion set at the same density threshold. We determine the geometric, topological and morphological properties of the cosmic web at a large set of density levels by computing Minkowski functionals for every supercluster and void using SURFGEN. The properties of the largest (percolating) supercluster and the complementary void are found to be very different from properties of individual superclusters and voids. Individual superclusters totally occupy no more than about 5{\%} of the total volume and contain no more than 20{\%} of mass if the largest supercluster is excluded. Likewise, individual voids totally occupy no more than 14{\%} of volume and contain no more than 4{\%} of mass if the largest void is excluded. Although superclusters are more massive and voids are more voluminous the difference in maximum volumes is not greater than by an order of magnitude. The genus value of individual superclusters can be 5 while the genus of individual voids can reach 40, implying significant amount of substructure in superclusters and especially in voids. One of our main results is that large voids, as defined through the density field (read dark matter distribution) can be distinctly non-spherical.},

abstract = {We present a purely geometrical method for probing the expansion history of the Universe from the observation of the shape of stacked voids in spectroscopic redshift surveys. Our method is an Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test based on the average sphericity of voids posited on the local isotropy of the Universe. It works by comparing the temporal extent of cosmic voids along the line of sight with their angular, spatial extent. We describe the algorithm that we use to detect and stack voids in redshift shells on the light cone and test it on mock light cones produced from N-body simulations. We establish a robust statistical model for estimating the average stretching of voids in redshift space and quantify the contamination by peculiar velocities. Finally, assuming that the void statistics that we derive from N-body simulations is preserved when considering galaxy surveys, we assess the capability of this approach to constrain dark energy parameters. We report this assessment in terms of the figure of merit (FoM) of the dark energy task force and in particular of the proposed EUCLID mission which is particularly suited for this technique since it is a spectroscopic survey. The FoM due to stacked voids from the EUCLID wide survey may double that of all other dark energy probes derived from EUCLID data alone (combined with Planck priors). In particular, voids seem to outperform Baryon Acoustic Oscillations by an order of magnitude. This result is consistent with simple estimates based on mode-counting. The AP test based on stacked voids may be a significant addition to the portfolio of major dark energy probes and its potentialities must be studied in detail.},

The very fast code used calculates the statistics of clusters along with the direct detection of percolation. We found that the two parameters mu(infinity), characterizing the size of the largest cluster, and mu-squared, characterizing the weighted mean size of all clusters excluding the largest one, are extremely useful for evaluating the percolation threshold. An advantage of using these parameters is their low sensitivity to boundary effects. We show that both the CDM and the C + HDM models are extremely filamentary both in mass and galaxy distribution. The percolation thresholds for the mass distributions are determined.},

We determine the mass function in the concordance {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM cosmology, as well as its uncertainty, using sixteen 10243 particle nested-volume dark matter simulations spanning a mass range of over 5 orders of magnitude. Using the nested volumes and single-halo tests, we find and correct for a systematic error in the friends-of-friends halo-finding algorithm. We find a fitting form and full error covariance for the mass function that successfully describes the simulations' mass function and is well behaved outside the simulations' resolutions. Estimated forecasts of uncertainty in cosmological parameters from future cluster-count surveys receive a negligible contribution from remaining statistical uncertainties in the central cosmology multiplicity function. There exists a potentially nonnegligible cosmological dependence (nonuniversality) of the halo multiplicity function.},

abstract = {We investigate the interpolation of power spectra of matter fluctuations using artificial neural networks (PkANN). We present a new approach to confront small-scale non-linearities in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. This ever-present and pernicious uncertainty is often the Achilles heel in cosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to see the advent of precision cosmology in the late-time Universe. We show that an optimally trained artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with a set of cosmological parameters (? and redshift z), can provide a worst-case error ≤1 per cent (for z≤ 2) fit to the non-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes up to k≤ 0.7 h Mpc-1. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire parameter space. This is a significant improvement over some of the current matter power spectrum calculators. In this paper, we detail how an accurate interpolation of the matter power spectrum is achievable with only a sparsely sampled grid of cosmological parameters. Unlike large-scale N-body simulations which are computationally expensive and/or infeasible, a well-trained ANN can be an extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting cosmological observations and parameter estimation. This paper is the first in a series. In this method paper, we generate the non-linear matter power spectra using HALOFIT and use them as mock observations to train the ANN. This work sets the foundation for Paper II, where a suite of N-body simulations will be used to compute the non-linear matter power spectra at sub-per cent accuracy, in the quasi-non-linear regime (0.1 ≤k≤ 0.9 h Mpc-1). A trained ANN based on this N-body suite will be released for the scientific community.},

abstract = {We apply the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE) to reconstruct and analyze the matter distribution and cosmic velocity flows in the Local Universe on the basis of the PSCz galaxy survey. The prime objective of this study is the production of optimal resolution three-dimensional maps fully volume-covering of the volume-weighted velocity and density fields throughout the nearby Universe, out to a distance of 150 Mpc/h. Based on the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation defined by the spatial galaxy sample, DTFE involves the estimate of density values on the basis of the volume of the related Delaunay tetrahedra and the subsequent use of theDelaunay tessellation as natural multidimensional (linear) interpolation grid for the corresponding density and velocity fields throughout the sample volume. The linearized model of the spatial galaxy distribution and the corresponding peculiar velocities of the PSCz galaxy sample, produced by Brachini et al. (1999), forms the input sample for the DTFE study. The DTFE maps reproduce the high-density supercluster regions in optimal detail, both their internal structure as well as their elongated or flattened shape. The corresponding velocity flows trace the bulk and shear flows marking the region extending from the Pisces-Perseus supercluster, via the Local superclusters, towards the Hydra-Centaurus and the Shapley concentration. The most outstanding and unique feature of the DTFE maps is the sharply defined radial outflow regions in and around underdense voids, marking the dynamical importance of voids in the Local Universe. The maximum expansion rate of voids defines a sharp cutoff in the DTFE velocity divergence pdf. We found that on the basis of this cutoff DTFE manages to consistently reproduce the value of Om {\{}{\~{}}{\}} 0.35 underlying the linearized velocity dataset.},

abstract = {We use machine learning (ML) to populate large dark matter-only simulations with baryonic galaxies. Our ML framework takes input halo properties including halo mass, environment, spin, and recent growth history, and outputs central galaxy and overall halo baryonic properties including stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), metallicity, and neutral hydrogen mass. We apply this to the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, and show that it recovers the mean trends of output quantities with halo mass highly accurately, including following the sharp drop in SFR and gas in quenched massive galaxies. However, the scatter around the mean relations is under-predicted. Examining galaxies individually, at {\$}z=0{\$} the stellar mass and metallicity are accurately recovered ({\$}\backslashsigma\backslashlesssim 0.2{\$}{\~{}}dex), but SFR and HI show larger scatter ({\$}\backslashsigma\backslashgtrsim 0.3{\$}{\~{}}dex); these values improve somewhat at {\$}z=1,2{\$}. Remarkably, ML quantitatively recovers second parameter trends in galaxy properties, e.g. that galaxies with higher gas content and lower metallicity have higher SFR at a given {\$}M{\_}*{\$}. Testing various ML algorithms, we find that none performs significantly better than the others. Ensembling the algorithms does not fare better, likely because of correlations between the algorithms and the fact that none of the algorithms predict the large observed scatter around the mean properties. For the random forest, we find that halo mass and nearby ({\$}\backslashsim 200{\$}{\~{}}kpc) environment are the most important predictive variables followed by growth history. We find that halo spin and {\$}\backslashsim{\$}Mpc scale environment are not. Finally we study the impact of additionally inputting key baryonic properties {\$}M{\_}*{\$}, SFR, and {\$}Z{\$}, as would be available e.g. from an equilibrium model, and show that particularly providing the SFR enables HI to be recovered substantially more accurately.},

This yields a galaxy map that can be compared to that of the Lick data. In the model there are 7.5 million galaxies at a mean space density of 0.065 h-cubed per Mpc (H = 100 h km/s per Mpc), and 386,000 galaxies are visible at apparent magnitudes of no more than 18.9 and galactic latitudes of at least 40 deg.

But the physical correspondence between the cosmic web and structural-engineering or textile 'spiderwebs' is even deeper than previously known, and extends to origami tessellations as well. Here we explain that in a good structure-formation approximation known as the adhesion model, threads of the cosmic web form a spiderweb, i.e. can be strung up to be entirely in tension. The correspondence is exact if nodes sampling voids are included, and if structure is excluded within collapsed regions (walls, filaments and haloes), where dark-matter multistreaming and baryonic physics affect the structure. We also suggest how concepts arising from this link might be used to test cosmological models: for example, to test for large-scale anisotropy and rotational flows in the cosmos.},

This analysis is often exploratory, where scientists are unable to enumerate the possible types of signal prior to performing the experiment.

In this work, we show that meaningful physical content can be revealed by transforming the raw data into a learned high-level representation using deep neural networks, with measurements taken at the Daya Bay Neutrino Experiment as a case study. We further show how convolutional deep neural networks can provide an effective classification filter with greater than 97{\{}{\%}{\}} accuracy across different classes of physics events, significantly better than other machine learning approaches.},

Using the VoidFinder algorithm as described by Hoyle 2002, we identify 1054 statistically significant voids in the northern galactic hemisphere with radii {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 10 h -1 Mpc. The filling factor of voids in the sample volume is 62{\{}{\%}{\}}. The largest void is just over 30 h -1 Mpc in effective radius. The median effective radius is 17 h -1 Mpc. The voids are found to be significantly underdense, with density contrast delta {\{}{\textless}{\}} -0.85 at the edges of the voids. The radial density profiles of these voids are similar to predictions of dynamically distinct underdensities in gravitational theory. We find 8,046 galaxies brighter than Mr = -20.09 within the voids, accounting for 7{\{}{\%}{\}} of the galaxies. We compare the results of VoidFinder on SDSS DR7 to mock catalogs generated from a SPH halo model simulation as well as other Lambda -CDM simulations and find similar void fractions and void sizes in the data and simulations.

The WISE Point Source Catalog contains more than 560 million objects, among them hundreds of thousands of galaxies with Active Nuclei (AGN). While type 1 AGN, owing to their bright and unobscured nature, are easy to detect and constitute a rather complete and unbiased sample, their type 2 counterparts, postulated by AGN unification, are not as straightforward to identify. Matching the WISE catalog with known QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we confirm previous identification of the type 1 locus in the WISE color space. Using a very large database of the popular CLUMPY torus models, we find the colors of the putative type 2 counterparts, and also, for the first time, predict their number vs. flux relation that can be expected to be observed in any given WISE color range. This will allow us to put statistically very significant constraints on the torus parameters. Our results are a successful test of the AGN unification scheme.},

@article{Aragon-Calvo2012,
abstract = {Contrary to the common view voids have very complex internal structure and dynamics. Here we show how the hierarchy of structures in the density field inside voids is reflected by a similar hierarchy of structures in the velocity field. Voids defined by dense filaments and clusters can de described as simple expanding domains with coherent flows everywhere except at their boundaries. At scales smaller that the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding sub-domains corresponding to sub- voids. These sub-domains break into even smaller sub-sub domains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of locally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity field responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining the sub voids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale components of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids but they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them cosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations allowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids also act like time machines by "freezing" the development of the medium-scale density fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of structures seen connecting proto galaxies in computer simulations. As a result of this freezing haloes in voids can remain "connected" to this tenuous web until the present time. This may have an important effect in the formation and evolution of galaxies in voids by providing an efficient gas accretion mechanism via coherent low-velocity streams that can keep a steady inflow of matter for extended periods of time.},

abstract = {In this work, we present cosmological N-body simulations of the Local Universe with initial conditions constrained by the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) within a cubic volume of 180 h-1 Mpc side-length centred at the Local Group. We use a self-consistent Bayesian-based approach to explore the joint parameter space of primordial density fluctuations and peculiar velocity fields, which are compatible with the 2MRS galaxy distribution after cosmic evolution. This method (the KIGEN code) includes the novel augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) structure formation model which combines second-order LPT (2LPT) on large scales with the spherical collapse model on small scales. Furthermore, we describe coherent flows with 2LPT and include a dispersion term to model fingers of god (fogs) arising from virialized structures. These implementations are crucial to avoid artificial parallel filamentary structures, which appear when using the structure formation model with the 2LPT approximation and the data with compressed fogs. We assume $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology throughout our method. The recovered initial Gaussian fields are used to perform a set of 25 constrained simulations. Statistically, this ensemble of simulations is in agreement with a reference set of 25 simulations based on randomly seeded Gaussian fluctuations in terms of matter statistics, power spectra and mass functions. Considering the entire volume of (180 h-1 Mpc)3, we obtain correlation coefficients of about 98.3 per cent for the cell-to-cell comparison between the simulated density fields and the galaxy density field in log space with Gaussian smoothing scales of rS = 3.5 h-1 Mpc (74 per cent for rS = 1.4 h-1 Mpc). The cross power spectra show correlations with the galaxy distribution which weakens towards smaller length-scales until they vanish at scales of 2.2-3.0 h-1 Mpc. The simulations we present provide a fully non-linear density and velocity field with a high level of correlation with the observed galaxy distribution at scales of a few Mpc.},

The Cosmic Web is the salient and pervasive foamlike pattern in which matter has organized itself on scales of a few up to more than a hundred Megaparsec. First, we describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE). The DTFE formalism is shown to recover the hierarchical nature and the anisotropic morphology of the cosmic matter distribution. The Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) uses the DTFE density field to extract the diverse morphological elements - filaments, sheets and clusters - on the basis of a ScaleSpace analysis which searches for these morphologies over a range of scales. Subsequently, we discuss the Watershed Voidfinder (WVF), which invokes the discrete watershed transform to identify voids in the cosmic matter distribution. The WVF is able to determine the location, size and shape of the voids. The watershed transform is also a key element in the SpineWeb analysis of the cosmic matter distribution. It allows the determination of the filamentary spine and connected walls in the cosmic matter density field through the identification of the singularities and corresponding separatrices. Finally, we describe the concept of Alphashapes for assessing the topology of the cosmic matter distribution.},

abstract = {The initial conditions and relevant physics for the formation of the earliest galaxies are well specified in the concordance cosmology. Using ab initio cosmological Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamical calculations, we discuss how very massive stars start the process of cosmological reionization. The models include nonequilibrium primordial gas chemistry and cooling processes and accurate radiation transport in the case B approximation using adaptively ray-traced photon packages, retaining the time derivative in the transport equation. Supernova feedback is modeled by thermal explosions triggered at parsec scales. All calculations resolve the local Jeans length by at least 16 grid cells at all times and as such cover a spatial dynamic range of {\{}{\~{}}{\}}106. These first sources of reionization are highly intermittent and anisotropic and first photoionize the small-scale voids surrounding the halos they form in, rather than the dense filaments they are embedded in. As the merging objects form larger, dwarf-sized galaxies, the escape fraction of UV radiation decreases and the H II regions only break out on some sides of the galaxies, making them even more anisotropic. In three cases, SN blast waves induce star formation in overdense regions that were formed earlier from ionization front instabilities. These stars form tens of parsecs away from the center of their parent DM halo. Approximately five ionizing photons are needed per sustained ionization when star formation in 106 M☉ halos is dominant in the calculation. As the halos become larger than {\{}{\~{}}{\}}107 M☉, the ionizing photon escape fraction decreases, which in turn increases the number of photons per ionization to 15-50, in calculations with stellar feedback only. Radiative feedback decreases clumping factors by 25{\{}{\%}{\}} when compared to simulations without star formation and increases the average temperature of ionized gas to values between 3000 and 10,000 K.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of filament and void environments on galaxies, looking for residual effects beyond the known relations with environment density. We quantified the host environment of galaxies as the distance to the spine of the nearest filament, and compared various galaxy properties within 12 bins of this distance. We considered galaxies up to 10 {\{}{\$}{\}}h{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-1{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}Mpc from filaments, i.e. deep inside voids. The filaments were defined by a point process (the Bisous model) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 10. In order to remove the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment density and redshift, we applied weighting to normalise the corresponding distributions of galaxy populations in each bin. After the normalisation with respect to environment density and redshift, several residual dependencies of galaxy properties still remain. Most notable is the trend of morphology transformations, resulting in a higher elliptical-to-spiral ratio while moving from voids towards filament spines, bringing along a corresponding increase in the {\{}{\$}{\}}g-i{\{}{\$}{\}} colour index and a decrease in star formation rate. After separating elliptical and spiral subsamples, some of the colour index and star formation rate evolution still remains. The mentioned trends are characteristic only for galaxies brighter than about {\{}{\$}{\}}M{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}r{\{}{\}}{\}} = -20{\{}{\$}{\}} mag. Unlike some other recent studies, we do not witness an increase in the galaxy stellar mass while approaching filaments. The detected transformations can be explained by an increase in the galaxy-galaxy merger rate and/or the cut-off of extragalactic gas supplies (starvation) near and inside filaments. Unlike voids, large-scale galaxy filaments are not a mere density enhancement, but have their own specific impact on the constituent galaxies, reducing the star formation rate and raising the chances of elliptical morphology also at a fixed environment density level.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing has become one of the most powerful tools available for investigating the 'dark side' of the universe. Cosmological strong gravitational lensing, in particular, probes the properties of the dense cores of dark matter halos over decades in mass and offers the opportunity to study the distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions otherwise unavailable. Studies of strongly-lensed variable sources offer yet further scientific opportunities. One of the challenges in realizing the potential of strong lensing is to understand the statistical context of both the individual systems that receive extensive follow-up study, as well as that of the larger samples of strong lenses that are now emerging from survey efforts. Motivated by these challenges, we have developed an image-simulation pipeline, PICS (Pipeline for Images of Cosmological Strong lensing) to generate realistic strong gravitational lensing signals from group and cluster scale lenses. PICS uses a low-noise and unbiased density estimator based on (resampled) Delaunay Tessellations to calculate the density field; lensed images are produced by ray-tracing images of actual galaxies from deep Hubble Space Telescope observations. Other galaxies, similarly sampled, are added to fill in the light cone. The pipeline further adds cluster-member galaxies and foreground stars into the lensed images. The entire image ensemble is then observed using a realistic point spread function which includes appropriate detector artifacts for bright stars. Noise is further added, including such non-Gaussian elements as noise window-paning from mosaiced observations, residual bad pixels, and cosmic rays. The aim is to produced simulated images that appear identical - to the eye (expert or otherwise) - to real observations in various imaging surveys.},

abstract = {We report the results of the first study of the multi-stream environment of dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations in the LCDM cosmology. The full dynamical state of dark matter can be described as a three-dimensional sub-manifold in six dimensional phase space - the dark matter sheet. In our study we use a Lagrangian sub-manifold x = x(q,t) (where x and q are co-moving Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates respectively), which is dynamically equivalent to the dark matter sheet but is more convenient for numerical analysis. Our major results can be summarized as follows. At the resolution of the simulation i.e. without additional smoothing, the cosmic web represents a hierarchical structure: each halo is embedded in the filamentary framework of the web predominantly at the filament crossings, and each filament is embedded in the wall like fabric of the web at the wall crossings. Locally, each halo or sub-halo is a peak in the number of streams field. The number of streams in the neighbouring filaments is higher than in the neighbouring walls. The walls are regions where number of streams is equal to three or a few. Voids are uniquely defined by the local condition requiring to be a single-stream flow region. The shells of streams around haloes are quite thin and the closest void region is typically within one and a half FOF radius from the center of the halo.},

abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began observations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and eBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS. This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all SDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes publicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to targeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected objects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the APOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously included and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For the SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with DR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and format of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to the important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data reduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data, tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from the planned {\{}{\~{}}{\}}6-year operations of SDSS-IV.},

abstract = {We study the nature of voids defined as single-stream regions that have not undergone shell-crossing. We use ORIGAMI to determine the cosmic web morphology of each dark matter particle in a suite of cosmological {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, which explicitly calculates whether a particle has crossed paths with others along multiple sets of axes and does not depend on a parameter or smoothing scale. The theoretical picture of voids is that of expanding underdensities with borders defined by shell-crossing. We find instead that locally underdense single-stream regions are not bounded on all sides by multi-stream regions, thus they percolate, filling the simulation volume; we show that the set of multi-stream particles also percolates. This percolation persists to high resolution, where the mass fraction of single-stream voids is low, because the volume fraction remains high; we speculate on the fraction of collapsed mass in the continuum limit of infinite resolution. By introducing a volume threshold parameter to define underdense void "cores", we create a catalog of ORIGAMI voids which consist entirely of single-stream particles and measure their percolation properties, volume functions, and average densities.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We present a new method to identify large‐scale filaments and apply it to a cosmological simulation. Using positions of haloes above a given mass as node tracers, we look for filaments between them using the positions and masses of all the remaining dark matter (DM) haloes. In order to detect a filament, the first step consists in the construction of a backbone linking two nodes, which is given by a skeleton‐like path connecting the highest local DM density traced by non‐node haloes. The filament quality is defined by a density and gap parameters characterizing its skeleton, and filament members are selected by their binding energy in the plane perpendicular to the filament. This membership condition is associated to characteristic orbital times; however if one assumes a fixed orbital time‐scale for all the filaments, the resulting filament properties show only marginal changes, indicating that the use of dynamical information is not critical for the method. We test the method in the simulation using massive haloes (M {\textgreater} 1014 h−1 M⊙) as filament nodes. The main properties of the resulting high‐quality filaments (which corresponds to ≃33 per cent of the detected filaments) are (i) their lengths cover a wide range of values of up to 150 h−1 Mpc, but are mostly concentrated below 50 h−1 Mpc; (ii) their distribution of thickness peaks at d= 3.0 h−1 Mpc and increases slightly with the filament length; (iii) their nodes are connected on average to 1.87 ± 0.18 filaments for ≃ 1014.1 M⊙ nodes; this number increases with the node mass to ≃ 2.49 ± 0.28 filaments for ≃ 1014.9 M⊙ nodes; (iv) on average, the central density along the filaments starts at almost a hundred times the average density in the regions surrounding the nodes and then drops to about a few times the mean density at larger distances, where it remains roughly constant over 20–80 per cent of the filament length (this result may depend on the filament length); (v) there is a strong relation between length, quality and how straight a filament is, where shorter filaments are those characterized by higher qualities and more straight‐line‐like geometries.},

abstract = {Cosmology is entering an era of percent level precision due to current large observational surveys. This precision in observation is now demanding more accuracy from numerical methods and cosmological simulations. In this paper, we study the accuracy of N-body numerical simulations and their dependence on changes in the initial conditions and in the simulation algorithms. For this purpose, we use a series of cosmological N-body simulations with varying initial conditions. We test the influence of the initial conditions, namely the pre-initial configuration (preIC), the order of the Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT), and the initial redshift (zini), on the statistics associated with the large scale structures of the universe such as the halo mass function, the density power spectrum, and the maximal extent of the large scale structures. We find that glass or grid pre-initial conditions give similar results at z 2. However, the initial excess of power in the glass initial conditions yields a subtle difference in the power spectra and the mass function at high redshifts. The LPT order used to generate the initial conditions of the simulations is found to play a crucial role. First-order LPT (1LPT) simulations underestimate the number of massive haloes with respect to second-order (2LPT) ones, typically by 2{\{}{\%}{\}} at 1014h-1M {\{}{\^{a}}{\}}{\{}{\v{S}}{\}}™ for an initial redshift of 23, and the small-scale power with an underestimation of 6{\{}{\%}{\}} near the Nyquist frequency for zini=23. Larger underestimations are observed for lower starting redshifts. Moreover, at higher redshifts, the high-mass end of the mass function is significantly underestimated in 1LPT simulations. On the other hand, when the LPT order is fixed, the starting redshift has a systematic impact on the low-mass end of the halo mass function. Lower starting redshifts yield more low-mass haloes. Finally, we compare two N-body codes, Gadget-3 and GOTPM, and find 8{\{}{\%}{\}} differences in the power spectrum at small scales and in the low-mass end of the halo mass function.},

While many discoveries will be made using LSST data alone, taking full scientific advantage of LSST will require ground-based optical-infrared (OIR) supporting capabilities, e.g., observing time on telescopes, instrumentation, computing resources, and other infrastructure. This community-based study identifies, from a science-driven perspective, capabilities that are needed to maximize LSST science. Expanding on the initial steps taken in the 2015 OIR System Report, the study takes a detailed, quantitative look at the capabilities needed to accomplish six representative LSST-enabled science programs that connect closely with scientific priorities from the 2010 decadal surveys. The study prioritizes the resources needed to accomplish the science programs and highlights ways that existing, planned, and future resources could be positioned to accomplish the science goals.},

abstract = {A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations. In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes.

abstract = {Recently, we have shown how current cosmological N-body codes already follow the fine grained phase-space information of the dark matter fluid. Using a tetrahedral tesselation of the three-dimensional manifold that describes perfectly cold fluids in six-dimensional phase space, the phase-space distribution function can be followed throughout the simulation. This allows one to project the distribution function into configuration space to obtain highly accurate densities, velocities, and velocity dispersions. Here, we exploit this technique to show first steps on how to devise an improved particle-mesh technique. At its heart, the new method thus relies on a piecewise linear approximation of the phase space distribution function rather than the usual particle discretisation. We use pseudo-particles that approximate the masses of the tetrahedral cells up to quadrupolar order as the locations for cloud-in-cell (CIC) deposit instead of the particle locations themselves as in standard CIC deposit. We demonstrate that this modification already gives much improved stability and more accurate dynamics of the collisionless dark matter fluid at high force and low mass resolution. We demonstrate the validity and advantages of this method with various test problems as well as hot/warm-dark matter simulations which have been known to exhibit artificial fragmentation. This completely unphysical behaviour is much reduced in the new approach. The current limitations of our approach are discussed in detail and future improvements are outlined.},

abstract = {The initial shear field, characterized by a primordial perturbation potential, plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures. Hence, considerable analytic work has been based on the joint distribution of its eigenvalues, associated with Gaussian statistics. In addition, directly related morphological quantities such as ellipticity or prolateness are essential tools in understanding the formation and structural properties of haloes, voids, sheets and filaments, their relation with the local environment, and the geometrical and dynamical classification of the cosmic web. To date, most analytic work has been focused on Doroshkevich's unconditional formulae for the eigenvalues of the linear tidal field, which neglect the fact that haloes (voids) may correspond to maxima (minima) of the density field. I present here new formulae for the constrained eigenvalues of the initial shear field associated with Gaussian statistics, which include the fact that those eigenvalues are related to regions where the source of the displacement is positive (negative): this is achieved by requiring the Hessian matrix of the displacement field to be positive (negative) definite. The new conditional formulae naturally reduce to Doroshkevich's unconditional relations, in the limit of no correlation between the potential and the density fields. As a direct application, I derive the individual conditional distributions of eigenvalues and point out the connection with previous literature. Finally, I outline other possible theoretically or observationally oriented uses, ranging from studies of halo and void triaxial formation, development of structure-finding algorithms for the morphology and topology of the cosmic web, to an accurate mapping of the gravitational potential environment of galaxies from current and future generation galaxy redshift surveys.},

abstract = {We present the relation between the genus in cosmology and the Betti numbers for excursion sets of three- and two-dimensional smooth Gaussian random fields, and numerically investigate the Betti numbers as a function of threshold level. Betti numbers are topological invariants of figures that can be used to distinguish topological spaces. In the case of the excursion sets of a three-dimensional field there are three possibly non-zero Betti numbers; {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}0{\{}{\$}{\}} is the number of connected regions, {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}1{\{}{\$}{\}} is the number of circular holes, and {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}2{\{}{\$}{\}} is the number of three-dimensional voids. Their sum with alternating signs is the genus of the surface of excursion regions. It is found that each Betti number has a dominant contribution to the genus in a specific threshold range. {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}0{\{}{\$}{\}} dominates the high-threshold part of the genus curve measuring the abundance of high density regions (clusters). {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}1{\{}{\$}{\}} dominates the genus near the median thresholds which measures the topology of negatively curved iso-density surfaces, and {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}2{\{}{\$}{\}} corresponds to the low-threshold part measuring the void abundance. We average the Betti number curves (the Betti numbers as a function of the threshold level) over many realizations of Gaussian fields and find that both the amplitude and shape of the Betti number curves depend on the slope of the power spectrum {\{}{\$}{\}}n{\{}{\$}{\}} in such a way that their shape becomes broader and their amplitude drops less steeply than the genus as {\{}{\$}{\}}n{\{}{\$}{\}} decreases. This behaviour contrasts with the fact that the shape of the genus curve is fixed for all Gaussian fields regardless of the power spectrum. Even though the Gaussian Betti number curves should be calculated for each given power spectrum, we propose to use the Betti numbers for better specification of the topology of large scale structures in the universe.},

abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state 'wCDM' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models -- the "Coyote Universe" suite -- can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.},

Identifying voids with the VIDE toolkit, we find no statistically significant differences in the ellipticities, but find that coupling produces a population of significantly larger voids, possibly explaining the recent result of Tavasoli et al.

(2014) to quantify the relationship between coupling and density profile shape, finding that the coupling leads to deeper underdensities for medium-scale voids and broader, shallower, undercompensated profiles for large voids. We find that these differences are potentially measurable with existing void catalogs once effects from survey geometries and peculiar velocities are taken into account.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter halo properties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends, spherical-overdensity and phase-space-based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allow halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe.  All the halo-finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo, and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Through a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase-space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high-resolution cosmological volume, we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity and peak of the rotation curve).  We further suggest to utilize the peak of the rotation curve, vmax, as a proxy for mass, given the arbitrariness in defining a proper halo edge. Airport code for Madrid, Spain},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\^{}}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\^{}}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

abstract = {The large-scale structure of the universe is comprised of virialized$\backslash$nblob-like clusters, linear filaments, sheet-like walls and huge near empty$\backslash$nthree-dimensional voids. Characterizing the large scale universe is essential$\backslash$nto our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The density$\backslash$nrange of clusters, walls and voids are relatively well separated, when compared$\backslash$nto filaments, which span a relatively larger range. The large scale filamentary$\backslash$nnetwork thus forms an intricate part of the cosmic web.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn this paper, we describe Felix, a topology based framework for visual$\backslash$nexploration of filaments in the cosmic web. The filamentary structure is$\backslash$nrepresented by the ascending manifold geometry of the 2-saddles in the$\backslash$nMorse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy of$\backslash$nMorse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at$\backslash$nthe end points of the filaments. The query is processed efficiently over the$\backslash$nentire hierarchical Morse-Smale complex, allowing for interactive$\backslash$nvisualization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe apply Felix to computer simulations based on the heuristic Voronoi$\backslash$nkinematic model and the standard {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM cosmology, and demonstrate its$\backslash$nusefulness through two case studies. First, we extract cosmic filaments within$\backslash$nand across cluster like regions in Voronoi kinematic simulation datasets. We$\backslash$ndemonstrate that we produce similar results to existing structure finders.$\backslash$nFilaments that form the spine of the cosmic web, which exist in high density$\backslash$nregions in the current epoch, are isolated using Felix. Also, filaments present$\backslash$nin void-like regions are isolated and visualized. These filamentary structures$\backslash$nare often over shadowed by higher density range filaments and are not easily$\backslash$ncharacterizable and extractable using other filament extraction methodologies.},

abstract = {Cosmological {\{}{\$}{\}}N{\{}{\$}{\}}-body simulations play a vital role in studying how the Universe evolves. To compare to observations and make scientific inference, statistic analysis on large simulation datasets, e.g., finding halos, obtaining multi-point correlation functions, is crucial. However, traditional in-memory methods for these tasks do not scale to the datasets that are forbiddingly large in modern simulations. Our prior paper proposes memory-efficient streaming algorithms that can find the largest halos in a simulation with up to {\{}{\$}{\}}10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}9{\{}{\$}{\}} particles on a small server or desktop. However, this approach fails when directly scaling to larger datasets. This paper presents a robust streaming tool that leverages state-of-the-art techniques on GPU boosting, sampling, and parallel I/O, to significantly improve the performance and scalability. Our rigorous analysis on the sketch parameters improves the previous results from finding the {\{}{\$}{\}}10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}} largest halos to {\{}{\$}{\}}10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}6{\{}{\$}{\}}, and reveals the trade-offs between memory, running time and number of halos, {\{}{\$}{\}}k{\{}{\$}{\}}. Our experiments show that our tool can scale to datasets with up to {\{}{\$}{\}}10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}12{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} particles, while using less than an hour of running time on a single Nvidia GTX GPU.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Ascasibar2010,
abstract = {The Field Estimator for Arbitrary Spaces (FiEstAS) computes the continuous probability density field underlying a given discrete data sample in multiple, non-commensurate dimensions. The algorithm works by constructing a metric-independent tessellation of the data space based on a recursive binary splitting. Individual, data-driven bandwidths are assigned to each point, scaled so that a constant "mass" M0 is enclosed. Kernel density estimation may then be performed for different kernel shapes, and a combination of balloon and sample point estimators is proposed as a compromise between resolution and variance. A bias correction is evaluated for the particular (yet common) case where the density is computed exactly at the locations of the data points rather than at an uncorrelated set of locations. By default, the algorithm combines a top-hat kernel with M0 = 2.0 with the balloon estimator and applies the corresponding bias correction. These settings are shown to yield reasonable results for a simple test case, a two-dimensional ring, that illustrates the performance for oblique distributions, as well as for a six-dimensional Hernquist sphere, a fairly realistic model of the dynamical structure of stellar bulges in galaxies and dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations. Results for different parameter settings are discussed in order to provide a guideline to select an optimal configuration in other cases. Source code is available upon request. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Simulations in which particles are initially distributed independently are compared with simulations in which a flat spectrum of random waves is truncated on small scales. The former simulations model hierarchical clustering from white noise initial conditions while the latter represent the growth of structure in the pancake model. The Poisson simulations form tight clusters with no large-scale coherence whereas the pancake simulations produce long chains. The correlation function in the Poisson simulation grows in a self-similar fashion and is not well fitted by a power law, whereas in the pancake models it has roughly power law behavior over the range 100-1 with a slope that increases with time. The pancake models fit the filamentary structure of the observed galaxy distribution considerably better than the Poisson models.},

abstract = {We present an exact general remeshing scheme to compute analytic integrals of polynomial functions over the intersections between convex polyhedral cells of old and new meshes. In physics applications this allows one to ensure global mass, momentum, and energy conservation while applying higher-order polynomial interpolation. We elaborate on applications of our algorithm arising in the analysis of cosmological N-body data, computer graphics, and continuum mechanics problems. We focus on the particular case of remeshing tetrahedral cells onto a Cartesian grid such that the volume integral of the polynomial density function given on the input mesh is guaranteed to equal the corresponding integral over the output mesh. We refer to this as "physically conservative voxelization". At the core of our method is an algorithm for intersecting two convex polyhedra by successively clipping one against the faces of the other. This algorithm is an implementation of the ideas presented abstractly by Sugihara (1994), who suggests using the planar graph representations of convex polyhedra to ensure topological consistency of the output. This makes our implementation robust to geometric degeneracy in the input. We employ a simplicial decomposition to calculate moment integrals up to quadratic order over the resulting intersection domain. We also address practical issues arising in a software implementation, including numerical stability in geometric calculations, management of cancellation errors, and extension to two dimensions. In a comparison to recent work, we show substantial performance gains. We provide a C implementation intended to be a fast, accurate, and robust tool for geometric calculations on polyhedral mesh elements.},

abstract = {We use a series of N-body simulations of the LCDM cosmology to investigate the redshift evolution since z=1 of the properties and alignment with the large-scale structure of haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids. We find that: (i) Once a rescaling of the halo mass with M*, the mass scale collapsing at redshift z, is performed, there is no further significant redshift dependence in the halo properties; (ii) The environment influences halo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with masses M{\textless}M*; and (iii) There is a significant alignment of both spin and shape of haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a) Haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*, halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M{\textgreater}M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters; c) Haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane independent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and haloes with M{\textgreater}M* perpendicular to it. For masses M{\textgreater}M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass scale M* sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS-environment either begins to affect, or reverses, the properties of dark matter haloes.},

abstract = {Quantifying image distortions caused by strong gravitational lensing and estimating the corresponding matter distribution in lensing galaxies has been primarily performed by maximum likelihood modeling of observations. This is typically a time and resource-consuming procedure, requiring sophisticated lensing codes, several data preparation steps, and finding the maximum likelihood model parameters in a computationally expensive process with downhill optimizers. Accurate analysis of a single lens can take up to a few weeks and requires the attention of dedicated experts. Tens of thousands of new lenses are expected to be discovered with the upcoming generation of ground and space surveys, the analysis of which can be a challenging task. Here we report the use of deep convolutional neural networks to accurately estimate lensing parameters in an extremely fast and automated way, circumventing the difficulties faced by maximum likelihood methods. We also show that lens removal can be made fast and automated using Independent Component Analysis of multi-filter imaging data. Our networks can recover the parameters of the Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid density profile, commonly used to model strong lensing systems, with an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties of sophisticated models, but about ten million times faster: 100 systems in approximately 1s on a single graphics processing unit. These networks can provide a way for non-experts to obtain lensing parameter estimates for large samples of data. Our results suggest that neural networks can be a powerful and fast alternative to maximum likelihood procedures commonly used in astrophysics, radically transforming the traditional methods of data reduction and analysis.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure of the matter distribution in the Universe due to the action of the gravitational instability -- the cosmic web -- is complicated by lack of direct analytic access to the nonlinear domain of structure formation. Here, we suggest and apply a novel tessellation method designed for cold dark matter (CDM) N-body cosmological simulations. The method is based on the fact that the initial CDM state can be described by a 3-D manifold (in a 6-D phase space) that remains continuous under evolution. Our technique uses the full phase space information and has no free parameters; it can be used to compute multi-stream and density fields, the main focus of this paper. Using a large-box LCDM simulation we carry out a variety of initial analyses with the technique. These include studying the correlation between multi-streaming and density, the identification of structures such as Zel'dovich pancakes and voids, and statistical measurements of quantities such as the volume fraction as a function of the number of streams -- where we find a remarkable scaling relation. Cosmological implications are briefly discussed.},

This study demonstrates that cultural differences exist between scientific fields and also supports existing policy recommendations that encourage the creation of organizations and partnerships at university level to allow scientists to more easily participate in activities with broader impacts. Emphasizing broader impacts activities may also attract a more diverse scientific workforce, as many individuals do not pursue science because of a perceived lack of impact.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of the substructure properties of a single Milky Way sized dark matter halo from the Aquarius suite at five different resolutions, as identified by a variety of different (sub-)halo finders for simulations of cosmic structure formation. These finders span a wide range of techniques and methodologies to extract and quantify substructures within a larger non-homogeneous background density (e.g. a host halo). This includes real-space, phase-space, velocity-space and time- space based finders, as well as finders employing a Voronoi tessellation, friends-of-friends techniques, or refined meshes as the starting point for locating substructure.A common post-processing pipeline was used to uniformly analyse the particle lists provided by each finder. We extract quantitative and comparable measures for the subhaloes, primarily focusing on mass and the peak of the rotation curve for this particular study. We find that all of the finders agree extremely well on the presence and location of substructure and even for properties relating to the inner part part of the subhalo (e.g. the maximum value of the rotation curve). For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the subhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that basic properties (mass, maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably recovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence can be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20. We finally note that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is remarkably consistent and {\textless}1 for all the finders that reached high resolution. If correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively, substructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of the (sub-)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.},

abstract = {The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment. One important question is how their angular momentum reflects the surrounding cosmic web. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the spin axes of spiral and elliptical galaxies relative to their surrounding filament/sheet orientations. To detect filaments, a marked point process with interactions (the " Bisous model ") is used. Sheets are found by detecting " flattened " filaments. The minor axes of ellipticals are found to be preferentially perpendicular to hosting filaments. A weak correlation is found with sheets. These findings are consistent with the notion that elliptical galaxies formed via mergers, which predominantly occurred along the filaments. The spin axis of spiral galaxies is found to align with the host filament, with no correlation between spiral spin and sheet normal. When examined as a function of distance from the filament axis, a much stronger correlation is found in the outer parts, suggesting that the alignment is driven by the laminar infall of gas from sheets to filaments. When compared with numerical simulations, our results suggest that the connection between dark matter halo and galaxy spin is not straightforward. Our results provide an important input to the understanding of how galaxies acquire their angular momentum.},

abstract = {We study the shapes of subhalo distributions from four dark-matter-only simulations of Milky Way type haloes (Springel et al. 2008). The subhaloes have been identified by ten subhalo finders at up to five different resolution levels (Onions et al. 2012). Comparing the shapes derived from the subhalo distributions at high resolution to those of the underlying dark matter fields we find the former to be more triaxial if the analysis is restricted to massive subhaloes. For three of the four analysed haloes the increased triaxiality of the distributions of massive subhaloes can be explained by a systematic effect caused by the low number of objects. Subhaloes of the fourth halo show indications for anisotropic accretion via their strong triaxial distribution and orbit alignment with respect to the dark matter field. At low resolution levels the shape measurements of the subhalo distributions consisting of the 13 most massive objects identified by the different subhalo finders are strongly scattered. Comparing the shape of the observed Milky Way satellite distribution to those of high-resolution subhalo samples from simulations, we find an agreement for samples of bright satellites, but significant deviations if faint satellites are included in the analysis. These deviations might result from observational incompleteness.},

The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

Using both an analytical model of planetary density and numerical simulations utilizing the Fast Accurate Integrand Renormalization (FAIR) algorithm (a fast geodesics calculator described below) with realistic planetary density inputs, dark matter streams moving through a compact body are shown to produce hugely magnified dark matter densities along the stream velocity axis going through the center of the body.

abstract = {Profiles of dark matter-dominated halos at the group and cluster scales play an important role in modern cosmology. Using results from two very large cosmological N-body simulations, which increase the available volume at their mass resolution by roughly two orders of magnitude, we robustly determine the halo concentration-mass {\{}{\$}{\}}(c-M){\{}{\$}{\}} relation over a wide range of masses employing multiple methods of concentration measurement. We characterize individual halo profiles as well as stacked profiles, relevant for galaxy-galaxy lensing and next-generation cluster surveys; the redshift range covered is {\{}{\$}{\}}0\backslashbackslashleq z \backslashbackslashleq 4{\{}{\$}{\}}, with a minimum halo mass of {\{}{\$}{\}}M{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}200c{\{}{\}}{\}}\backslashbackslashsim2\backslashbackslashtimes10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}11{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashrm M{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}\backslashbackslashodot{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}. Despite the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger history, nonsphericity, relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the nonlinear mass scale {\{}{\$}{\}}M{\{}{\_}{\}}\backslashbackslashstar(z){\{}{\$}{\}}, we find that a simple non-power law form for the {\{}{\$}{\}}c-M/M{\{}{\_}{\}}\backslashbackslashstar{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} relation provides an excellent description of our simulation results across eight decades in {\{}{\$}{\}}M/M{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashstar{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} and for {\{}{\$}{\}}0\backslashbackslashleq z \backslashbackslashleq 4{\{}{\$}{\}}. Over the mass range covered, the {\{}{\$}{\}}c-M{\{}{\$}{\}} relation has two asymptotic forms: an approximate power law below a mass threshold {\{}{\$}{\}}M/M{\{}{\_}{\}}\backslashbackslashstar\backslashbackslashsim 500-1000{\{}{\$}{\}}, transitioning to a constant value, {\{}{\$}{\}}c{\{}{\_}{\}}0\backslashbackslashsim 3{\{}{\$}{\}} at higher masses. The relaxed halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashsim 0.5{\{}{\$}{\}} above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Einasto fits to stacked profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; expectedly, the Einasto profile provides a better description of the simulation results. At cluster scales at low redshift, however, both NFW and Einasto profiles are in very good agreement with the simulation results, consistent with recent weak lensing observations.},

abstract = {We describe how the dynamics of cosmic structure formation defines the intricate geometric structure of the spine of the cosmic web. The Zeldovich approximation is used to model the backbone of the cosmic web in terms of its singularity structure. The description by Arnold et al. (1982) in terms of catastrophe theory forms the basis of our analysis. This two-dimensional analysis involves a profound assessment of the Lagrangian and Eulerian projections of the gravitationally evolving four-dimensional phase-space manifold. It involves the identification of the complete family of singularity classes, and the corresponding caustics that we see emerging as structure in Eulerian space evolves. In particular, as it is instrumental in outlining the spatial network of the cosmic web, we investigate the nature of spatial connections between these singularities. The major finding of our study is that all singularities are located on a set of lines in Lagrangian space. All dynamical processes related to the caustics are concentrated near these lines. We demonstrate and discuss extensively how all 2D singularities are to be found on these lines. When mapping this spatial pattern of lines to Eulerian space, we find a growing connectedness between initially disjoint lines, resulting in a percolating network. In other words, the lines form the blueprint for the global geometric evolution of the cosmic web.},

abstract = {Despite a history that dates back at least a quarter of a century studies of voids in the large-scale structure of the Universe are bedevilled by a major problem: there exist a large number of quite different void-finding algorithms, a fact that has so far got in the way of groups comparing their results without worrying about whether such a comparison in fact makes sense. Because of the recent increased interest in voids, both in very large galaxy surveys and in detailed simulations of cosmic structure formation, this situation is very unfortunate. We here present the first systematic comparison study of thirteen different void finders constructed using particles, haloes, and semi-analytical model galaxies extracted from a subvolume of the Millennium simulation. The study includes many groups that have studied voids over the past decade. We show their results and discuss their differences and agreements. As it turns out, the basic results of the various methods agree very well with each other in that they all locate a major void near the centre of our volume. Voids have very underdense centres, reaching below 10 percent of the mean cosmic density. In addition, those void finders that allow for void galaxies show that those galaxies follow similar trends. For example, the overdensity of void galaxies brighter than mB = -20 is found to be smaller than about -0.8 by all our void finding algorithms.},

abstract = {We present an analytical model for the nonspherical collapse of overdense regions out of a Gaussian random field of initial cosmological perturbations. The collapsing region is treated as an ellipsoid of constant density, acted upon by the quadrupole tidal shear from the surrounding matter. The dynamics of the ellipsoid is set by the ellipsoid self-gravity and the external quadrupole shear. Both forces are linear in the coordinates and therefore maintain homogeneity of the ellipsoid at all times. The amplitude of the external shear is evolved into the nonlinear regime in thin spherical shells that are allowed to move only radially according to mass interior to them. The full dynamical equations then reduce to a set of nine second-order ordinary differential equations, which reproduce the linear regime behavior but can be evolved past turnaround, well into the nonlinear regime. We describe how the initial conditions can be drawn in the appropriate correlated way from a random field of initial density perturbations. The model is applied to a restricted set of initial conditions that are more suitable to the above approximations; most notable we focus on the properties of rare high-density peaks (greater than of approximately = 2 sigma). By considering many random realization of the initial conditions, we calculate the distributions of shapes and angular momenta acquired by objects through the coupling of their quadruole moment to the tidal shear. The average value of the spin parameter, (mean value of a lambda) approximately = 0.04, is found to be only weakly dependent on the system mass, the mean cosmological density, or the initial power spectrum of perturbations, in agreement with N-body simulations. For the cold dark matter power spectrum, most objects evolve from a quasi-spherical initial state to a pancake or filament and then to complete virialization. Low-spin objects tend to be more spherical. The evolution history of shapes is primarily induced by the external shear and not by the initial triaxially of the objects. The statistical distribution of the triaxial shapes of collapsing region can be used to test cosmological models against galaxy surveys on large scales.},

abstract = {Profiles of dark matter-dominated halos at the group and cluster scales play an important role in modern cosmology. Using results from two very large cosmological N-body simulations, which increase the available volume at their mass resolution by roughly two orders of magnitude, we robustly determine the halo concentration-mass {\$}(c-M){\$} relation over a wide range of masses employing multiple methods of concentration measurement. We characterize individual halo profiles as well as stacked profiles, relevant for galaxy-galaxy lensing and next-generation cluster surveys; the redshift range covered is {\$}0\backslashleq z \backslashleq 4{\$}, with a minimum halo mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}200c{\}}\backslashsim2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. Despite the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger history, nonsphericity, relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the nonlinear mass scale {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar(z){\$}, we find that a simple non-power law form for the {\$}c-M/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} relation provides an excellent description of our simulation results across eight decades in {\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} and for {\$}0\backslashleq z \backslashleq 4{\$}. Over the mass range covered, the {\$}c-M{\$} relation has two asymptotic forms: an approximate power law below a mass threshold {\$}M/M{\_}\backslashstar\backslashsim 500-1000{\$}, transitioning to a constant value, {\$}c{\_}0\backslashsim 3{\$} at higher masses. The relaxed halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of {\$}\backslashsim 0.5{\$} above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Einasto fits to stacked profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; expectedly, the Einasto profile provides a better description of the simulation results. At cluster scales at low redshift, however, both NFW and Einasto profiles are in very good agreement with the simulation results, consistent with recent weak lensing observations.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the number density of voids in the dark matter distribution from a series of N-body simulations of a {\$}\Lambda{\$} cold dark matter cosmology. We define voids as spherical regions of {\$}\rho{\$}v = 0.2{\$}\rho{\$}m around density minima in order to relate our results to the predicted abundances using the excursion set formalism. Using a linear underdensity of {\$}\delta{\$}v = −2.7, from a spherical evolution model, we find that a volume-conserving model, which does not conserve number density in the mapping from the linear to non-linear regime, matches the measured abundance to within 16 per cent for a range of void radii 1 {\{}{\textless}{\}} r(h−1 Mpc) {\{}{\textless}{\}} 15. This model fixes the volume fraction of the universe which is in voids and assumes that voids of a similar size merge as they expand by a factor of 1.7 to achieve a non-linear density of {\$}\rho{\$}v = 0.2{\$}\rho{\$}m today. We find that the model of Sheth and van de Weygaert for the number density of voids greatly overpredicts the abundances over the same range of scales. We find that the volume-conserving model works well at matching the number density of voids measured from the simulations at higher redshifts, z = 0.5 and 1, as well as correctly predicting the abundances to within 25 per cent in a simulation of a matter dominated {\$}\Omega{\$}m = 1 universe. We examine the abundance of voids in the halo distribution and find fewer small, r {\{}{\textless}{\}} 10 h−1 Mpc, voids and many more large, r {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 10 h−1 Mpc, voids compared to the dark matter. These results indicate that voids identified in the halo or galaxy distribution are related to the underlying void distribution in the dark matter in a complicated way which merits further study if voids are to be used as a precision probe of cosmology.},

Our work encompasses a systematic investigation of the void volume function, the volume fraction in voids, and the fitting of voids to corresponding ellipsoids and spheres. We emphasize the relevance of the percolation threshold to the void volume statistics of the density field both in the high redshift, Gaussian random field regime, as well as in the present epoch.

We look at the evolution of the alignment of halo spins with filaments and with each other, as well as the spin parameter, which is a measure of the magnitude of angular momentum. It was found that the angular momentum vectors of dark matter halos at high redshift have a weak tendency to be orthogonal to filaments and high-mass halos have a stronger orthogonal alignment than low-mass halos. Since z = 1, the spins of low-mass halos have become weakly aligned parallel to filaments, whereas high-mass halos kept their orthogonal alignment. This recent parallel alignment of low-mass halos casts doubt on tidal torque theory as the sole mechanism for the buildup of angular momentum. We see evidence for bulk flows and the broadening of filaments over time in the alignments of halo spin and velocities. We find a significant alignment of the spin of neighboring dark matter halos only at very small separations, r {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.3 Mpc h −1 , which is driven by substructure. A correlation of the spin parameter with halo mass is confirmed at high redshift.},

abstract = {The cosmic web is the largest scale manifestation of the anisotropic gravitational collapse of matter. It represents the transitional stage between linear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information about the early phases of structure formation processes. Here we investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components. Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis identifies clusters and filaments as the most prominent components of the web. In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present-day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into walls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than 100 h-1 Mpc. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to form along approximatively straight lines.},

abstract = {We present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at high redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in {\{}{\~{}}{\}}10 dynamical times, or {\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.5Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state, with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, {\{}{\~{}}{\}}100 Msun/yr, and each clump converts into stars in {\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z{\{}{\~{}}{\}}3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z{\{}{\~{}}{\}}1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high-z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

We present an exact expression for the number of galaxy pairs in this term based on the the survey mask, which leads to more than a factor of three increase in the shape noise on the largest measured scales for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KIDS-450) real-space cosmic shear data. We compare the result of this analytic expression to several alternative methods for measuring the shape noise from the data and find excellent agreement. This update to the covariance resolves any internal model tension evidenced by the previously large cosmological best-fit {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashchi{\{}\backslash{\^{}}{\{}{\}}{\}}2{\{}{\$}{\}} for the KiDS-450 cosmic shear data. The best-fit {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashchi{\{}\backslash{\^{}}{\{}{\}}{\}}2{\{}{\$}{\}} is reduced from 161 to 121 for 118 degrees of freedom. We also apply a correction to how the multiplicative shear calibration uncertainty is included in the covariance. This change, along with a previously known update to the reported effective angular values of the data vector, jointly shift the inferred amplitude of the correlation function to higher values. We find that this improves agreement of the KiDS-450 cosmic shear results with Dark Energy Survey Year 1 and Planck results.},

@article{Feldbrugge2018,
abstract = {We present a general formalism for identifying the caustic structure of a dynamically evolving mass distribution, in an arbitrary dimensional space. The identification of caustics in fluids with Hamiltonian dynamics, viewed in Lagrangian space, corresponds to the classification of singularities in Lagrangian catastrophe theory. On the basis of this formalism we develop a theoretical framework for the dynamics of the formation of the cosmic web, and specifically those aspects that characterize its unique nature: its complex topological connectivity and multiscale spinal structure of sheetlike membranes, elongated filaments and compact cluster nodes. Given the collisionless nature of the gravitationally dominant dark matter component in the universe, the presented formalism entails an accurate description of the spatial organization of matter resulting from the gravitationally driven formation of cosmic structure. The present work represents a significant extension of the work by Arnol'd et al. [1], who classified the caustics that develop in one- and two-dimensional systems that evolve according to the Zel'dovich approximation. His seminal work established the defining role of emerging singularities in the formation of nonlinear structures in the universe. At the transition from the linear to nonlinear structure evolution, the first complex features emerge at locations where different fluid elements cross to establish multistream regions. Involving a complex folding of the 6-D sheetlike phase-space distribution, it manifests itself in the appearance of infinite density caustic features. The classification and characterization of these mass element foldings can be encapsulated in caustic conditions on the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the deformation tensor field. In this study we introduce an alternative and transparent proof for Lagrangian catastrophe theory. This facilitates the derivation of the caustic conditions for general Lagrangian fluids, with arbitrary dynamics. Most important in the present context is that it allows us to follow and describe the full three-dimensional geometric and topological complexity of the purely gravitationally evolving nonlinear cosmic matter field. While generic and statistical results can be based on the eigenvalue characteristics, one of our key findings is that of the significance of the eigenvector field of the deformation field for outlining the entire spatial structure of the caustic skeleton emerging from a primordial density field. In this paper we explicitly consider the caustic conditions for the three-dimensional Zel'dovich approximation, extending earlier work on those for one- and two-dimensional fluids towards the full spatial richness of the cosmic web. In an accompanying publication, we apply this towards a full three-dimensional study of caustics in the formation of the cosmic web and evaluate in how far it manages to outline and identify the intricate skeletal features in the corresponding N -body simulations.},

abstract = {We present the results of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), a ten-year project to map the full three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe. The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly a million galaxies with Ks {\{}{\textless}{\}}= 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5° for bright galaxies. Near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with Ks {\{}{\textless}{\}}= 11.75 mag and |b| {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}= 5° ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}=8° toward the Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a redshift catalog that is 97.6{\{}{\%}{\}} complete to well-defined limits and covers 91{\{}{\%}{\}} of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity fields out to 50 h -1 Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies with Ks {\{}{\textless}{\}}= 11.25 mag and |b| {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}= 10°.},

Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct primordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe physics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an unconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on at least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any scale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two species at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how the primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are progressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in that of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low redshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of baryons and DM differs by ˜2 per cent at z = 9 and by 0.2 per cent at z = 0. The differences in the amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10 per cent at z = 9 and 1 per cent at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects expected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the power spectrum and the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected, given the precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. Hence, our results validate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distribution using predictions for the total mass clustering in the Universe.},

abstract = {I present a new approach to recover the primordial density fluctuations and the cosmic web structure underlying a galaxy distribution. The method is based on sampling Gaussian fields which are compatible with a galaxy distribution and a structure formation model. This is achieved by splitting the inversion problem into two Gibbs-sampling steps: the first being a Gaussianization step transforming a distribution of point sources at Lagrangian positions - which are not a priori given- into a linear alias-free Gaussian field. This step is based on Hamiltonian sampling with a Gaussian-Poisson model. The second step consists on a likelihood comparison in which the set of matter tracers at the initial conditions is constrained on the galaxy distribution and the assumed structure formation model. For computational reasons second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory is used. However, the presented approach is flexible to adopt any structure formation model. A semi-analytic halo-model-based galaxy mock catalogue is taken to demonstrate that the recovered initial conditions are closely unbiased with respect to the actual ones from the corresponding N-body simulation down to scales of a ˜5 Mpc h-1. The cross-correlation between them shows a substantial gain of information, being at k ˜ 0.3 h Mpc-1 more than doubled. In addition the initial conditions are extremely well Gaussian distributed and the power spectra follow the shape of the linear power spectrum being very close to the actual one from the simulation down to scales of k ˜ 1 h Mpc-1.},

Comparing voids in the dark matter distribution to those in the halo population, we address the question of whether galaxy redshift surveys yield sufficiently accurate void morphologies. Voids are identified using the parameter free Watershed Void Finder. The effect of redshift distortions is investigated as well. Results: We confirm the statistically significant sensitivity of voids in the dark matter distribution. We identify the level of clustering as measured by {\$}\backslash{\$}sigma{\{}{\_}{\}}8(z) as the main cause of differences in mean void shape {\{}{\textless}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}epsilon{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}. We find that in the halo and/or galaxy distribution it is practically unfeasible to distinguish at a statistically significant level between the various cosmologies due to the sparsity and spatial bias of the sample.},

abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of predicting the halo mass function from the properties of the Lagrangian density field. We focus on a perturbation spectrum with a small-scale cut-off (as in warm dark matter cosmologies). This cut-off results in a strong suppression of low mass objects, providing additional leverage to rigorously test which perturbations collapse and to what mass. We find that all haloes are consistent with forming near peaks of the initial density field, with a strong correlation between proto-halo density and ellipticity. We demonstrate that, while standard excursion set theory with correlated steps completely fails to reproduce the mass function, the inclusion of the peaks constraint leads to the correct number of haloes but significantly underpredicts the masses of low-mass objects (with the predicted halo mass function at low masses behaving like dn/dln m {\~{}} m{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}). This prediction is very robust and cannot be easily altered within the framework of a single collapse barrier. The nature of collapse in the presence of a small-scale cut-off thus reveals that excursion set calculations require a more detailed understanding of the collapse-time of a general ellipsoidal perturbation to predict the ultimate collapsed mass of a peak -- a problem that has been hidden in the large abundance of small-scale structure in CDM. We demonstrate how this problem can be resolved within the excursion set framework.},

abstract = {We present analysis of the evolution of dark matter halos in dense environments of groups and clusters in dissipationless cosmological simulations. The premature destruction of halos in such environments, known as the overmerging, reduces the predictive power of N-body simulations and makes difficult any comparison between models and observations. We analyze the possible processes that cause the overmerging and assess the extent to which this problem can be cured with current computer resources and codes. Using both analytic estimates and high-resolution numerical simulations, we argue that the overmerging is mainly due to the lack of numerical resolution. We find that the force and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in galaxy groups and clusters is extremely high and was almost never reached before: {\{}{\~{}}{\}}1-3 kpc and 108-109 M☉, respectively. We use the high-resolution Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART) N-body code to run cosmological simulations with particle mass ≈2 × 108 h-1 M☉ and spatial resolution ≈1-2 h-1 kpc and show that in these simulations the halos do survive in regions that would appear overmerged with lower force resolution. Nevertheless, the halo identification in very dense environments remains a challenge even with resolution this high. We present two new halo-finding algorithms developed to identify both isolated and satellite halos that are stable (existed at previous moments) and gravitationally bound. To illustrate the use of the satellite halos that survive the overmerging, we present a series of halo statistics, which can be compared with those of observed galaxies. Particularly, we find that, on average, halos in groups have the same velocity dispersion as the dark matter particles; i.e., they do not exhibit significant velocity bias. The small-scale (100 kpc to 1 Mpc) halo correlation function in both models is well described by the power law {\$}\xi{\$} r-1.7 and is in good agreement with observations. It is slightly antibiased (b≈0.7-0.9) relative to the dark matter. To test other galaxy statistics, we use the maximum of the halo rotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation to assign luminosity to the halos. For two cosmological models, a flat model with the cosmological constant and {\$}\Omega{\$}0=1-{\$}\Omega{\$}{\$}\Lambda{\$}=0.3,h=0.7 and a model with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter and {\$}\Omega{\$}0=1.0,{\$}\Omega{\$}{\$}\nu{\$}=0.2,h=0.5, we construct luminosity functions and evaluate mass-to-light ratios in groups. Both models produce luminosity functions and mass-to-light ratios ( {\{}{\~{}}{\}}200-400) that are in reasonable agreement with observations. The latter implies that the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy groups (at least for Mvir 3 × 1013 h-1 M☉ analyzed here) is not a good indicator of {\$}\Omega{\$}0.},

abstract = {We study the alignment of galaxies relative to their local environment in SDSS-DR8 and, using these data, we discuss evolution scenarios for different types of galaxies. We defined a vector field of the direction of anisotropy of the local environment of galaxies. We summed the unit direction vectors of all close neighbours of a given galaxy in a particular way to estimate this field. We found the alignment angles between the spin axes of disc galaxies, or the minor axes of elliptical galaxies, and the direction of anisotropy. The distributions of cosines of these angles are compared to the random distributions to analyse the alignment of galaxies. Sab galaxies show perpendicular alignment relative to the direction of anisotropy in a sparse environment, for single galaxies and galaxies of low luminosity. Most of the parallel alignment of Scd galaxies comes from dense regions, from 2...3 member groups and from galaxies with low luminosity. The perpendicular alignment of S0 galaxies does not depend strongly on environmental density nor luminosity; it is detected for single and 2...3 member group galaxies, and for main galaxies of 4...10 member groups. The perpendicular alignment of elliptical galaxies is clearly detected for single galaxies and for members of {\{}{\textless}{\}} 11 member groups; the alignment increases with environmental density and luminosity. We confirm the existence of fossil tidally induced alignment of Sab galaxies at low z. The alignment of Scd galaxies can be explained via the infall of matter to filaments. S0 galaxies may have encountered relatively massive mergers along the direction of anisotropy. Major mergers along this direction can explain the alignment of elliptical galaxies. Less massive, but repeated mergers are possibly responsible for the formation of elliptical galaxies in sparser areas and for less luminous elliptical galaxies.},

The empirical properties of observed voids are also not well understood. In this paper, we study voids in an N-body simulation, using the ZOBOV watershed algorithm. As in other studies, we use sets of subsampled dark matter particles as tracers to identify voids, but we use the full-resolution simulation output to measure dark matter densities at the identified locations. Voids span a wide range of sizes and densities, but there is a clear trend towards larger voids containing deeper density minima, a trend which is expected for all watershed void finders. We also find that the tracer density at void locations is usually smaller than the true density, and that this relationship depends on the sampling density of tracers. We show that fits given in the literature fail to match the observed density profiles of voids. The average enclosed density contrast within watershed voids varies widely with both the size of the void and the minimum density within it, but is always far from the shell crossing threshold expected from theoretical models. Voids with deeper density minima also show much broader density profiles. We discuss the implications of these results for the excursion set approach to modelling such voids.},

This algorithm, called Pico, can compute the CMB power spectrum and matter transfer function as well as any computationally expensive likelihoods in a few milliseconds. By removing these bottlenecks from parameter estimation codes, Pico decreases their computational time by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Pico has several important properties. First, it is extremely fast and accurate over a large volume of parameter space. Furthermore, its accuracy can continue to be improved by using a larger training set. This method is generalizable to an arbitrary number of cosmological parameters and to any range of l-values in multipole space. Pico is approximately 3000 times faster than CAMB for flat models, and approximately 2000 times faster then the WMAP 3 year likelihood code. In this paper, we demonstrate that using Pico to compute power spectra and likelihoods produces parameter posteriors that are very similar to those using CAMB and the official WMAP3 code, but in only a fraction of the time.

abstract = {The lecture notes describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator for Cosmic Web analysis. The high sensitivity of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations to the local point distribution is used to obtain estimates of density and related quantities. The adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of Delaunay tessellations are utilized for interpolation to continuous volume-covering density and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry preserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its hierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and structure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and background of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural Neighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques. This is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on spatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its performance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological applications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body simulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's performance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of the velocity flow in the Local Universe (implied by PSCz) illustrate its promise for probing the dynamics of cosmic structure. The Watershed Void Finder (Platen et al. 2007), for the study of voids, and Multiscale Morphology Filter (Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007), for identifying and analyzing weblike networks of filaments, sheets and clusters, are based upon DTFE density fields.

abstract = {N-body simulations have revealed a wealth of information about dark matter halos however their results are largely empirical. Using analytic means, we attempt to shed light on simulation results by generalizing the self-similar secondary infall model to include tidal torque. In this first of two papers, we describe our halo formation model and compare our results to empirical mass profiles inspired by N-body simulations. Each halo is determined by four parameters. One parameter sets the mass scale and the other three define how particles within a mass shell are torqued throughout evolution. We choose torque parameters motivated by tidal torque theory and N-body simulations and analytically calculate the structure of the halo in different radial regimes. We find that angular momentum plays an important role in determining the density profile at small radii. For cosmological initial conditions, the density profile on small scales is set by the time rate of change of the angular momentum of particles as well as the halo mass. On intermediate scales, however, {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashrho\backslashbackslashpropto r{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-2{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}, while {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashrho\backslashbackslashpropto r{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-3{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} close to the virial radius.},

abstract = {Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing is not only a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution of massive galaxies, but can also provide valuable cosmological constraints, either by studying the population of strong lenses or by measuring time delays in lensed quasars. Due to the rarity of galaxy-scale strongly lensed systems, fast and reliable automated lens finding methods will be essential in the era of large surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. To tackle this challenge, we introduce CMU DeepLens, a new fully automated galaxy-galaxy lens finding method based on Deep Learning. This supervised machine learning approach does not require any tuning after the training step which only requires realistic image simulations of strongly lensed systems. We train and validate our model on a set of 20,000 LSST-like mock observations including a range of lensed systems of various sizes and signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). We find on our simulated data set that for a rejection rate of non-lenses of 99{\%}, a completeness of 90{\%} can be achieved for lenses with Einstein radii larger than 1.4" and S/N larger than 20 on individual {\$}g{\$}-band LSST exposures. Finally, we emphasize the importance of realistically complex simulations for training such machine learning methods by demonstrating that the performance of models of significantly different complexities cannot be distinguished on simpler simulations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/McWilliamsCenter/CMUDeepLens .},

abstract = {Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of parameters to achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear, and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement, and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.},

abstract = {The boundaries of cold dark matter halos are commonly defined to enclose a density contrast {\$}\backslashDelta{\$} relative to a reference (mean or critical) density. We argue that a more physical boundary of halos is the radius at which accreted matter reaches its first orbital apocenter after turnaround. This splashback radius, {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$}, manifests itself as a sharp density drop in the halo outskirts, at a location that depends upon the mass accretion rate. We present calibrations of {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} and the enclosed mass, {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$}, as a function of the accretion rate and alternatively peak height. We find that {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} varies between {\$}\backslashapprox0.8-1R{\_}{\{}200m{\}}{\$} for rapidly accreting halos and {\$}\backslashapprox1.5R{\_}{\{}200m{\}}{\$} for slowly accreting halos. The extent of a halo and its associated environmental effects can thus extend well beyond the conventionally defined "virial" radius. We show that {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} and {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} evolve relatively strongly compared to other commonly used definitions. In particular, {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} evolves significantly even for the smallest dwarf-sized halos at {\$}z=0{\$}. We also contrast {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} with the mass enclosed within four scale radii of the halo density profile, {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\textless}4rs{\}}{\$}, which characterizes the inner halo. During the early stages of halo assembly, {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\textless}4rs{\}}{\$} evolve similarly, but in the late stages {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\textless}4rs{\}}{\$} stops increasing while {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} continues to grow significantly. This illustrates that halos at low {\$}z{\$} can have "quiet" interiors while continuing to accrete mass in their outskirts. We discuss potential observational estimates of the splashback radius and show that it may already have been detected in galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {The primordial velocity dispersion of dark matter is small compared to the velocities attained during structure formation. The initial density distribution is close to uniform, and it occupies an initial sheet in phase space that is single valued in velocity space. Because of gravitational forces, this 3D manifold evolves in phase space without ever tearing, conserving phase-space volume and preserving the connectivity of nearby points. N-body simulations already follow the motion of this sheet in phase space. This fact can be used to extract full fine-grained phase-space structure information from existing cosmological N-body simulations. Particles are considered as the vertices of an unstructured 3D mesh moving in 6D phase space. On this mesh, mass density and momentum are uniquely defined. We show how to obtain the space density of the fluid, detect caustics and count the number of streams as well as their individual contributions to any point in configuration space. We calculate the bulk velocity, local velocity dispersions and densities from the sheet - all without averaging over control volumes. This gives a wealth of new information about dark matter fluid flow which had previously been thought of as inaccessible to N-body simulations. We outline how this mapping may be used to create new accurate collisionless fluid simulation codes that may be able to overcome the sparse sampling and unphysical two-body effects that plague current N-body techniques.},

We review the framework of variational inference to obtain approximate posteriors of Bayesian neural networks and apply it to a network trained to estimate the parameters of the Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid plus external shear and total flux magnification. We show that the method can capture the uncertainties due to different levels of noise in the input data, as well as training and architecture-related errors made by the network. To evaluate the accuracy of the resulting uncertainties, we calculate the coverage probabilities of marginalized distributions for each lensing parameter. By tuning a single hyperparameter, the dropout rate, we obtain coverage probabilities approximately equal to the confidence levels for which they were calculated, resulting in accurate and precise uncertainty estimates. Our results suggest that neural networks can be a fast alternative to Monte Carlo Markov Chains for parameter uncertainty estimation in many practical applications, allowing more than seven orders of magnitude improvement in speed.},

abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2x10{\^{}}8 solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometers per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4x10{\^{}}8 solar masses. This implies that the ratio M{\_}{\{}halo{\}}/M{\_}{\{}stars{\}} is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected.

Within its virial radius this model contains about 2.0e7 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

We generate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid surveys. We verify our model against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), predicting 250 discoverable lenses compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al (2014). The predicted Einstein radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by Sonnenfeld et al (2013). For future surveys we find that, assuming Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches in DES, LSST and Euclid datasets should discover 2400, 120000, and 170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses respectively. Finders using blue minus red (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in DES and LSST. The uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high redshift source population which typically gives fractional errors on the discoverable lens number at the tens of percent level. We find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens to be detectable, approximately halves the number of detectable lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of understanding the selection function and sensitivity of future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes publicly available so that the selection function of strong lens finders can easily be calibrated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. The cosmic web is one of the most striking features of the distribution of galaxies and dark matter on the largest scales in the Universe. It is composed of dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened sheets and vast low-density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused primarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the environmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety of different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web - depending on the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other. In this paper, we bring 12 of these methods together and apply them to the same data set in order to understand how they compare. In general, these cosmic-web classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind, and to study different questions. Therefore, one would not a priori expect agreement between different techniques; however, many of these methods do converge on the identification of specific features. In this paper, we study the agreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method finds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that voids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find a substantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification scheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example, we find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e. M halo {\~{}} 10 13.5 h -1 M ⊙ ) as being in filaments. Lastly, so that any future cosmic-web classification scheme can be compared to the 12 methods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.},

abstract = {Tidal torque theory suggests that galaxies gain angular momentum in the linear stage of structure formation. Such a theory predicts alignments between the spin of haloes and tidal shear field. However, non-linear evolution and angular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. In this paper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiar velocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within {\$}115\backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}} {\$} ({\$}\backslashsim8000 \backslash, {\{}\backslashmathrm {\{}km{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslashmathrm s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) from 2MRS catalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes of shear field. Although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked at similar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments with velocity-shear field. Ellipticals in the 2MRS sample, show a statistically significant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. In general, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis of greatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression. Spiral galaxies show no signal. Such an alignment is significantly strengthened when considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity field reconstruction. When examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axis of greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. This result indicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairly noisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strong enough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered - especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.},

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\{}{\_}{\}}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\{}{\_}{\}}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\{}{\%}{\}} errors on measured parameters and 95{\{}{\%}{\}} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\{}{\_}{\}} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\{}{\_}{\}}K| {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\{}{\textless}{\}}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {We study the formation of dark matter halos in the concordance LCDM model over a wide range of redshifts, from z=20 to the present. Our primary focus is the halo mass function, a key probe of cosmology. By performing a large suite of nested-box N-body simulations with careful convergence and error controls (60 simulations with box sizes from 4 to 256 Mpc/h, we determine the mass function and its evolution with excellent statistical and systematic errors, reaching a few percent over most of the considered redshift and mass range. Across the studied redshifts, the halo mass is probed over 6 orders of magnitude (10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}7 - 10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}13.5 M{\{}{\_}{\}}sun/h). Historically, there has been considerable variation in the high redshift mass function as obtained by different groups. We have made a concerted effort to identify and correct possible systematic errors in computing the mass function at high redshift and to explain the discrepancies between some of the previous results. We discuss convergence criteria for the required force resolution, simulation box size, halo mass range, initial and final redshift, and time stepping. Because of conservative cuts on the mass range probed by individual boxes, our results are relatively insensitive to simulation volume, the remaining sensitivity being consistent with extended Press-Schechter theory. Previously obtained mass function fits near z=0, when scaled by linear theory, are in good agreement with our results at all redshifts, although a mild redshift dependence consistent with that found by Reed and collaborators exists at low redshifts.},

It was shown that collisions of mixed particles not only scatter them elastically, but can also change their mass eigenstates thus affecting particles' flavor composition and kinetic energy. The mass eigenstate conversions and elastic scattering are related but different processes, hence the conversion {\$}S{\$}-matrix elements can be arbitrarily large even when the elastic scattering {\$}S{\$}-matrix elements vanish. The conversions are efficient when the mass eigenstates are well-separated in space but suppressed if their wave-packets overlap; the suppression is most severe for mass-degenerate eigenstates in flat space-time. The mass eigenstate conversions can lead to an interesting process, called `quantum evaporation,' in which mixed particles, initially confined deep inside a gravitational potential well and scattering only off each other, can escape from it without extra energy supply leaving nothing behind inside the potential at {\$}t\backslashto \backslashinfty{\$}. Implications for the cosmic neutrino background and the two-component dark matter model are discussed and a prediction for the direct detection dark matter experiments is made.},

These points appear in contact zones of the velocity domains with different orientation of the averaged velocity vector. At the same time peculiar velocities are the cause of the scatter of the Hubble expansion rate. We propose that a more precise determination of the Hubble constant can be made by restricting analysis to subsample of observational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the peculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On large-scales the critical points where the first derivative of the gravitational potential vanishes can be easily identified using the density field and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational potential. We use high- resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions are stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially minimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of vanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging indiscriminately using the full data sets as is the common approach. This could help to reconcile the CMB-measured value of the Hubble constant with that obtained from the local measurements.},

abstract = {Modern N-body cosmological simulations contain billions ({\{}{\$}{\}}10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}9{\{}{\$}{\}}) of dark matter particles. These simulations require hundreds to thousands of gigabytes of memory, and employ hundreds to tens of thousands of processing cores on many compute nodes. In order to study the distribution of dark matter in a cosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halo finder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in the simulation. The resources required for halo finding are similar to the requirements for the simulation itself. In particular, simulations have become too extensive to use commonly-employed halo finders, such that the computational requirements to identify halos must now be spread across multiple nodes and cores. Here we present a scalable-parallel halo finding method called Parallel HOP for large-scale cosmological simulation data. Based on the halo finder HOP, it utilizes MPI and domain decomposition to distribute the halo finding workload across multiple compute nodes, enabling analysis of much larger datasets than is possible with the strictly serial or previous parallel implementations of HOP. We provide a reference implementation of this method as a part of the toolkit yt, an analysis toolkit for Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data that includes complementary analysis modules. Additionally, we discuss a suite of benchmarks that demonstrate that this method scales well up to several hundred tasks and datasets in excess of {\{}{\$}{\}}2000{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}} particles. The Parallel HOP method and our implementation can be readily applied to any kind of N-body simulation data and is therefore widely applicable.},

abstract = {We present a method to reconstruct the initial conditions of the universe using observed galaxy positions and luminosities under the assumption that the luminosities can be calibrated with weak lensing to give the mean halo mass. Our method relies on following the gradients of forward model and since the standard way to identify halos is non-differentiable and results in a discrete sample of objects, we propose a framework to model the halo position and mass field starting from the non-linear matter field using Neural Networks. We evaluate the performance of our model with multiple metrics. Our model is more than {\{}{\$}{\}}95\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\%}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} correlated with the halo-mass fields up to {\{}{\$}{\}}k\backslashbackslashsim 0.7 {\{}{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashrm h/Mpc{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} and significantly reduces the stochasticity over the Poisson shot noise. We develop a data likelihood model that takes our modeling error and intrinsic scatter in the halo mass-light relation into account and show that a displaced log-normal model is a good approximation to it. We optimize over the corresponding loss function to reconstruct the initial density field and develop an annealing procedure to speed up and improve the convergence. We apply the method to halo number densities of {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashbar{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}n{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}} = 2.5\backslashbackslashtimes 10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-4{\{}{\}}{\}} -10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-3{\{}{\}}{\}}({\{}{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashrm h/Mpc{\{}{\}}{\}}){\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}}, typical of current and future redshift surveys, and recover a Gaussian initial density field, mapping all the higher order information in the data into the power spectrum. We show that our reconstruction improves over the standard reconstruction. For baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) the gains are relatively modest because BAO is dominated by large scales where standard reconstruction suffices. We improve upon it by {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashsim 15-20\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\%}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} in terms of error on BAO peak as estimated by Fisher analysis at {\{}{\$}{\}}z=0{\{}{\$}{\}}.

abstract = {Several cosmological measurements have attained significant levels of maturity and accuracy over the last decade. Continuing this trend, future observations promise measurements of the statistics of the cosmic mass distribution at an accuracy level of one percent out to spatial scales with k{\{}{\~{}}{\}}10 h/Mpc and even smaller, entering highly nonlinear regimes of gravitational instability. In order to interpret these observations and extract useful cosmological information from them, such as the equation of state of dark energy, very costly high precision, multi-physics simulations must be performed. We have recently implemented a new statistical framework with the aim of obtaining accurate parameter constraints from combining observations with a limited number of simulations. The key idea is the replacement of the full simulator by a fast emulator with controlled error bounds. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the methodology and extend the framework to include joint analysis of cosmic microwave background and large scale structure measurements. Our framework is especially well-suited for upcoming large scale structure probes of dark energy such as baryon acoustic oscillations and, especially, weak lensing, where percent level accuracy on nonlinear scales is needed.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nPublished in: Phys.Rev.D76:083503,2007},

abstract = {A robust detection of the tidally induced intrinsic alignments of the late-type spiral galaxies with high statistical significance is reported. From the spectroscopic galaxy sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 compiled by Huertas-Company et al., which lists each galaxy's probabilities of being in five Hubble types, P(E), P(Ell), P(S0), P(Sab), P(Scd), we select the nearby large late-type spiral galaxies which have redshifts of 0 {\{}{\textless}{\}}= z {\{}{\textless}{\}}= 0.02, probabilities of P(Scd) {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}= 0.5, and angular sizes of D {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}= 7.92 arcsec. The spin axes of the selected nearby large late-type spiral galaxies are determined up to the two-fold ambiguity with the help of the circular thin-disk approximation, and their spatial correlations are measured as a function of the separation distance r. A clear signal of the intrinsic correlation as high as 3.4{\$}\sigma{\$} and 2.4{\$}\sigma{\$} is found at the separation distance of r ≈ 1 h -1 Mpc and r ≈ 2 h -1 Mpc, respectively. The comparison of this observational results with the analytic model based on the tidal torque theory reveals that the spin correlation function for the late-type spiral galaxies follows the quadratic scaling of the linear density correlation and that the intrinsic correlations of the galaxy spin axes are stronger than that of the underlying dark halos. We investigate a local density dependence of the galaxy spin correlations and found that the correlations are stronger for the galaxies located in dense regions having more than 10 neighbors within 2 h -1 Mpc. We also attempt to measure a luminosity dependence of the galaxy spin correlations, but find that it is impossible with our magnitude-split samples to disentangle a luminosity from a redshift dependence. We provide the physical explanations for these observational results and also discuss the effects of possible residual systematics on the results.},

abstract = {The increasing precision in the determination of the Hubble parameter has reached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced by inhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. Here we use large-scale cosmological N-body simulations to study statistical properties of the local Hubble parameter as measured by local observers. We show that the distribution of the local Hubble parameter depends not only on the scale of inhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in the cosmic web and what reference frame is used. Observers located in random dark matter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at random positions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect is stronger from the halo rest frames compared to the CMB rest frame. We compare the predictions for the local Hubble parameter with observational constraints based on type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and CMB observations. Due to cosmic variance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the Hubble constant determined from nearby SNIa may differ from that measured from the CMB by 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. This scatter is too small to significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between current measurements assuming a flat LCDM model. However, for observers located in the centres of the largest voids permitted by the standard LCDM model, we find that Hubble constant measurements from SNIa would be biased high by 5 per cent, rendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case.},

We develop the NEXUS method to incorporate the density, tidal field, velocity divergence and velocity shear as tracers of the cosmic web. We also present the NEXUS+ procedure which, taking advantage of a novel filtering of the density in logarithmic space, is very successful at identifying the filament and wall environments in a robust and natural way. To assess the algorithms we apply them to an N-body simulation. We find that all methods correctly identify the most prominent filaments and walls, while there are differences in the detection of the more tenuous structures. In general, the structures traced by the density and tidal fields are clumpier and more rugged than those present in the velocity divergence and velocity shear fields. We find that the NEXUS+ method captures much better the filamentary and wall networks and is successful in detecting even the fainter structures. We also confirm the efficiency of our methods by examining the dark matter particle and halo distributions.},

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\~{}}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to {\$}\backslashlesssim 0.2{\$} dex over the full mass range, {\$}10{\^{}}8 {\textless} M{\_}*/M{\_}\backslashodot \backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$}, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for {\$}M{\_}* \backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback.

abstract = {Despite the fact that the mean matter density of the universe has been measured to an accuracy of a few percent within the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, its median density is not known even to order of magnitude. Typical points lie in low-density regions and are not part of a collapsed structure of any scale. Locally, the dark matter distribution is then simply a stretched version of that in the early universe. In this single-stream regime, the distribution of unsmoothed density is sensitive to the initial power spectrum on all scales, in particular on very small scales, and hence to the nature of the dark matter. It cannot be estimated reliably using conventional cosmological simulations because of the enormous dynamic range involved, but a suitable excursion set procedure can be used instead. For the Planck cosmological parameters, a 100 GeV WIMP, corresponding to a free-streaming mass ∼ 10 −6 M , results in a median density of ∼ 4×10 −3 in units of the mean density, whereas a 10 µeV axion with free-streaming mass ∼ 10 −12 M gives ∼ 3 × 10 −3 , and Warm Dark Matter with a (thermal relic) mass of 1 keV gives ∼ 8 × 10 −2 . In CDM (but not in WDM) universes, single-stream regions are predicted to be topologically isolated by the excursion set formalism. A test by direct N-Body simulations seems to confirm this prediction, although it is still subject to finite size and resolution effects. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any of these properties is observable and so suitable for constraining the properties of dark matter.},

abstract = {We discuss an idealized model of halo formation, in which a collapsing halo node is tetrahedral, with a filament extruding from each of its four faces, and with a wall connecting each pair of filaments. In the model, filaments generally spin when they form, and the halo spins if and only if there is some rotation in filaments. This is the simplest-possible fully three-dimensional halo collapse in the 'origami approximation,' in which voids are irrotational, and the dark-matter sheet out of which dark-matter structures form is allowed to fold in position-velocity phase space, but not stretch (i.e., it cannot vary in density along a stream). Up to an overall scaling, the four filament directions, and only three other quantities, such as filament spins, suffice to determine all of the collapse's properties: the shape, mass, and spin of the halo; the densities per unit length and spins of all filaments; and masses per unit area of the walls. If the filaments are arranged regular-tetrahedrally, filament properties obey simple laws, reminiscent of angular-momentum conservation. The model may be most useful in understanding spin correlations between neighboring galaxies joined by filaments; these correlations would give intrinsic alignments between galaxies, essential to understand for accurate cosmological weak-lensing measurements.},

Finally we are also able to identify a population of isolated void galaxies. By running this algorithm on GAMA mock galaxy catalogues we compare the characteristics of large scale structure between observed and mock data; finding that mock filaments reproduce observed ones extremely well. This provides a probe of higher order distribution statistics not captured by the popularly used two-point correlation function.},

abstract = {The alignment of DM halos and the surrounding large scale structure (LSS) is examined in the context of the cosmic web. Halo spin, shape and the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the LSS using the eigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1 Mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. Knots, filaments, sheets and voids are associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principal directions simultaneously. Each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e. knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at the halo's position. The full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to be substantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that the observed velocity shear is significantly biased. We find that larger mass haloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansion or collapse is more spherical. A correlation is found between the halo's shape and the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis of the halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsing eigenvector. This correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocity shear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. A similar result is found for the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. It has been shown that high mass haloes exhibit a spin flip with rpespect to the LSS: we find the mass at which this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggested previously. Although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit an alignment with the LSS, providing a possible insight into the highly correlated co-rotation of the Milky Way's satellite system. The present study suggests that the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studying the directional properties of the non-linear LSS and of halos and galaxies.},

The breakdown of the perturbative expansion beyond shell-crossing is discussed, and it is shown, in a simple example, that the perturbative series can be extended to a transseries including nonperturbative terms. The latter converges to the exact result well beyond the range of validity of perturbation theory. The crucial role of the divergences induced by shell-crossing is discussed. They provide constraints on the structure of the transseries and act as a bridge between the perturbative and the nonperturbative sectors. Then, we show that the dynamics in the deep multistreaming regime is governed by attractors. In the case of simple initial conditions, these attractors coincide with the asymptotic configurations of the adhesion model, but in general they may differ. These results are applied to a cosmological setting, and an algorithm to build the attractor solution starting from the Zel'dovich approximation is developed. Finally, this algorithm is applied to the search of `haloes' and the results are compared with those obtained from the exact dynamical equations.},

abstract = {Using cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and gravitational forces, we investigate the influence of photoionization by a UV radiation background on the formation of galaxies. In our highest resolution simulations, we find that photoionization has essentially no effect on the baryonic mass function of galaxies at {\{}{\$}{\}}z=2{\{}{\$}{\}}, down to our resolution limit of {\{}{\$}{\}}5e9 M{\{}{\_}{\}}\backslashbackslashsun{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}. We do, however, find a strong interplay between the mass resolution of a simulation and the microphysics included in the computation of heating and cooling rates. At low resolution, a photoionizing background can appear to suppress the formation of even relatively massive galaxies. However, when the same initial conditions are evolved with a factor of eight better mass resolution, this effect disappears. Our results demonstrate the need for care in interpreting the results of cosmological simulations that incorporate hydrodynamics and radiation physics. For example, we conclude that a simulation with limited resolution may yield more realistic results if it ignores some relevant physical processes, such as photoionization. At higher resolution, the simulated population of massive galaxies is insensitive to the treatment of photoionization and star formation, but it does depend significantly on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations. By {\{}{\$}{\}}z=2{\{}{\$}{\}}, an {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashOmega=1{\{}{\$}{\}} cold dark matter model normalized to produce the observed masses of present-day clusters has already formed galaxies with baryon masses exceeding {\{}{\$}{\}}1e11 M{\{}{\_}{\}}\backslashbackslashsun{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}.},

abstract = {Recent observational studies have demonstrated that the majority of satellite galaxies tend to orbit their hosts on highly flattened, vast, possibly co-rotating planes. Two nearly parallel planes of satellites have been confirmed around the M31 galaxy and around the Centaurus A galaxy, while the Milky Way also sports a plane of satellites. It has been argued that such an alignment of satellites on vast planes is unexpected in the standard ({\{}{\{}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}Lambda{\{}{\}}{\}}CDM) model of cosmology if not even in contradiction to its generic predictions. Guided by {\{}{\{}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}Lambda{\{}{\}}{\}}CDM numerical simulations, which suggest that satellites are channeled towards hosts along the axis of the slowest collapse as dictated by the ambient velocity shear tensor, we re-examine the planes of local satellites systems within the framework of the local shear tensor derived from the Cosmicflows-2 dataset. The analysis reveals that the Local Group and Centaurus A reside in a filament stretched by the Virgo cluster and compressed by the expansion of the Local Void. Four out of five thin planes of satellite galaxies are indeed closely aligned with the axis of compression induced by the Local Void. Being the less massive system, the moderate misalignment of the Milky Way's satellite plane can likely be ascribed to its greater susceptibility to tidal torques, as suggested by numerical simulations. The alignment of satellite systems in the local universe with the ambient shear field is thus in general agreement with predictions of the {\{}{\{}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}Lambda{\{}{\}}{\}}CDM model.},

abstract = {We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P(k) from over 200,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with WMAP and other data. Our results are consistent with a ``vanilla'' flat adiabatic Lambda-CDM model without tilt (n=1), running tilt, tensor modes or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 sigma constraints on the Hubble parameter from h{\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.74+0.18-0.07 to h{\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.70+0.04-0.03, on the matter density from Omega{\{}{\_}{\}}m{\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.25+/-0.10 to Omega{\{}{\_}{\}}m{\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.30+/-0.04 (1 sigma) and on neutrino masses from {\{}{\textless}{\}}11 eV to {\{}{\textless}{\}}0.6 eV (95{\{}{\%}{\}}). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis of WMAP and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, which is an impressive consistency check with independent redshift survey data and analysis techniques. In this paper, we place particular emphasis on clarifying the physical origin of the constraints, i.e., what we do and do not know when using different data sets and prior assumptions. For instance, dropping the assumption that space is perfectly flat, the WMAP-only constraint on the measured age of the Universe tightens from t0{\{}{\~{}}{\}}16.3+2.3-1.8 Gyr to t0{\{}{\~{}}{\}}14.1+1.0-0.9 Gyr by adding SDSS and SN Ia data. Including tensors, running tilt, neutrino mass and equation of state in the list of free parameters, many constraints are still quite weak, but future cosmological measurements from SDSS and other sources should allow these to be substantially tightened.},

abstract = {A dynamical classification of the cosmic web is proposed. The large scale environment is classified into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor, i.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential, on a grid. The classification is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold, lambda{\_}th at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The collection of neighboring grid points, friends-of-friends, of the same web attribute constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as web objects. A simple dynamical consideration suggests that lambda{\_}th should be approximately unity, upon an appropriate scaling of the deformation tensor. The algorithm has been applied and tested against a suite of (dark matter only) cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions on lambda{\_}th and on the resolution has been calculated for the four web types. Also, the percolation properties of voids and filaments have been studied. Our main findings are: (a) Already at lambda{\_}th = 0.1 the resulting web classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (b) Between 0.2 {\textless} lambda{\_}th {\textless} 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of interconected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for lambda{\_}th as the parameter that defines the cosmic web. (c) The dynamical nature of the suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating environmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular the semi-analytical ones.},

abstract = {We describe our new `MLAPM halo finder' (MHF), which is based on the adaptive grid structure of the N-body code MLAPM. We then extend the MHF code in order to track the orbital evolution of gravitationally bound objects through any given cosmological N-body simulation - our so-called `MLAPM halo tracker' (MHT). The mode of operation of MHT is demonstrated using a series of eight high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy clusters. Each of these haloes hosts more than one million particles within their virial radii rvir. We use MHT as well as MHF to follow the temporal evolution of hundreds of individual satellites, and show that the radial distribution of these substructure satellites follows a `universal' radial distribution irrespective of the environment and formation history of the host halo. This in fact might pose another problem for simulations of cold dark matter structure formation, as there are recent findings by Taylor, Silk {\{}{\&}{\}} Babul that the Milky Way satellites are found preferentially closer to the Galactic Centre and simulations underestimate the amount of central substructure. Further, this universal substructure profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. The halo finder MHF will become part of the open source MLAPM distribution.},

abstract = {Evolution of initially smooth perturbations in a cold self-gravitating medium in a Friedmann Universe gives rise to the formation of singularities in the distribution of density in a manner similar to that of catastrophe theory. Using the approximate nonlinear theory of gravitational instability the objects formed were found to possess a very oblate shape–a “pancake” (Zeldovich, 1970). This result is shown in this paper to be a general feature of the evolution of so-called Lagrangian systems (Arnold, 1980). Pancakes are one of the several kinds of generic singularity formed at the nonlinear stage of evolution of such a system. Some of the others are a cusp, a beak-to-beak, a swailow-tail. In this paper we present the full list of singularities for the one- and two-dimensional cases (Figures 1-9). The three dimensional singularities will be discussed in Part II of the paper. We discuss the geometrical and some dynamical properties of each kind of singularity. We give also asymptotic laws for the growth of the density near each kind of singularity. This list of singularities gives the elements from which the large scale structure of the Universe is constructed.},

@article{Clampitt2017,
abstract = {Galaxies and their dark matter halos populate a complicated filamentary network around large, nearly empty regions known as cosmic voids. Cosmic voids are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information about the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an increasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void studies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position errors of {\$}\backslashsim50{\$} Mpc/{\$}h{\$} or more that can render many voids undetectable. In this paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys, validate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-{\$}z{\$} redMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV) data. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding voids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the line-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-{\$}z{\$} scatter, the number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic and photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20{\%} for all transverse void sizes, and indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius {\$}\backslashsim 70{\$} Mpc/{\$}h{\$} and larger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric voids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the algorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range {\$}0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.8{\$}, we identify 87 voids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc/{\$}h{\$}, and carry out a stacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of {\$}4.4\backslashsigma{\$}, the lensing measurement confirms the voids are truly underdense in the matter field and hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics in the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the viability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.},

abstract = {Understanding the velocity field is very important for modern cosmology: it gives insights to structure formation in general, and also its properties are crucial ingredients in modelling redshift-space distortions and in interpreting measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Unfortunately, characterising the velocity field in cosmological N-body simulations is inherently complicated by two facts: i) The velocity field becomes manifestly multi-valued after shell-crossing and has discontinuities at caustics. This is due to the collisionless nature of dark matter. ii) N-body simulations sample the velocity field only at a set of discrete locations, with poor resolution in low-density regions. In this paper, we discuss how the associated problems can be circumvented by using a phase-space interpolation technique. This method provides extremely accurate estimates of the cosmic velocity fields and its derivatives, which can be properly defined without the need of the arbitrary "coarse-graining" procedure commonly used. We explore in detail the configuration-space properties of the cosmic velocity field on very large scales and in the highly nonlinear regime. In particular, we characterise the divergence and curl of the velocity field, present their one-point statistics, analyse the Fourier-space properties and provide fitting formulae for the velocity divergence bias relative to the non-linear matter power spectrum. We furthermore contrast some of the interesting differences in the velocity fields of warm and cold dark matter models. We anticipate that the high-precision measurements carried out here will help to understand in detail the dynamics of dark matter and the structures it forms.},

abstract = {Here we introduce the Delaunay Density Estimator Method. Its purpose is rendering a fully volume-covering reconstruction of a density field from a set of discrete data points sampling this field. Reconstructing density or intensity fields from a set of irregularly sampled data is a recurring key issue in operations on astronomical data sets, both in an observational context as well as in the context of numerical simulations. Our technique is based upon the stochastic geometric concept of the Delaunay tessellation generated by the point set. We shortly describe the method, and illustrate its virtues by means of an application to an N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation. The presented technique is a fully adaptive method: automatically it probes high density regions at maximum possible resolution, while low density regions are recovered as moderately varying regions devoid of the often irritating shot-noise effects. Of equal importance is its capability to sharply and undilutedly recover anisotropic density features like filaments and walls. The prominence of such features at a range of resolution levels within a hierarchical clustering scenario as the example of the standard CDM scenario is shown to be impressively recovered by our scheme.},

abstract = {The next generation of cosmology experiments will be required to use photometric redshifts rather than spectroscopic redshifts. Obtaining accurate and well-characterized photometric redshift distributions is therefore critical for Euclid, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array. However, determining accurate variance predictions alongside single point estimates is crucial, as they can be used to optimize the sample of galaxies for the specific experiment (e.g. weak lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations, supernovae), trading off between completeness and reliability in the galaxy sample. The various sources of uncertainty in measurements of the photometry and redshifts put a lower bound on the accuracy that any model can hope to achieve. The intrinsic uncertainty associated with estimates is often non-uniform and input-dependent, commonly known in statistics as heteroscedastic noise. However, existing approaches are susceptible to outliers and do not take into account variance induced by non-uniform data density and in most cases require manual tuning of many parameters. In this paper, we present a Bayesian machine learning approach that jointly optimizes the model with respect to both the predictive mean and variance we refer to as Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz). The predictive variance of the model takes into account both the variance due to data density and photometric noise. Using the SDSS DR12 data, we show that our approach substantially outperforms other machine learning methods for photo-z estimation and their associated variance, such as TPZ and ANNz2. We provide a Matlab and Python implementations that are available to download at https://github.com/OxfordML/GPz .},

abstract = {We present vide, the Void IDentification and Examination toolkit, an open-source Python/C++ code for finding cosmic voids in galaxy redshift surveys and N-body simulations, characterizing their properties, and providing a platform for more detailed analysis. At its core, vide uses a substantially enhanced version of zobov (Neyinck 2008) to calculate a Voronoi tessellation for estimating the density field and performing a watershed transform to construct voids. Additionally, vide provides significant functionality for both pre- and post-processing: for example, vide can work with volume- or magnitude-limited galaxy samples with arbitrary survey geometries, or dark matter particles or halo catalogs in a variety of common formats. It can also randomly subsample inputs and includes a Halo Occupation Distribution model for constructing mock galaxy populations. vide uses the watershed levels to place voids in a hierarchical tree, outputs a summary of void properties in plain ASCII, and provides a Python API to perform many analysis tasks, such as loading and manipulating void catalogs and particle members, filtering, plotting, computing clustering statistics, stacking, comparing catalogs, and fitting density profiles. While centered around ZOBOV, the toolkit is designed to be as modular as possible and accommodate other void finders. vide has been in development for several years and has already been used to produce a wealth of results, which we summarize in this work to highlight the capabilities of the toolkit. vide is publicly available at http://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide{\_}public and http://www.cosmicvoids.net.},
