\section{Zel'dovich Approximation}
% Taken from the Caustics paper

\label{sec:ZA}

ZA is an elegant analytical approximation to describe the non-linear gravitational evolution of collisionless particles in continuous media. \hl{Technically it is the first oder Lagrangian perturbation theory, however Zeldovich suggested to extrapolate it to the beginning of the non-perturbative nonlinear stage and predicted the formation of caustics which are the boundaries of
the first very thin multistream regions dubbed by him  'pancakes'.}
ZA describes a dynamical mapping from the initial Lagrangian coordinates $\mathbf{q}$ to Eulerian positions at time $t$. In comoving coordinates, $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{r}/a(t)$ (where $\mathbf{r}$ is the physical coordinate  and $a(t)$ is the scale factor; \hl{(?) assuming normalization $a(z=0)=1, \mathbf{r}$ are 
the physical coordinates of particles at present} ), ZA takes the form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ZA1}
 \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{q}, D(t) ) = \mathbf{q} + D(t) s(\mathbf{q}) 
\end{equation}

where $D(t)$ is the linear density growth factor, and the the initial density perturbation field $\psi(\mathbf{q})$ determines the potential vector field $\mathbf{s(q)} = - \nabla_q \psi(\mathbf{q})$. 
% The initial cosmic density field is a realization of a Gaussian random process, specified completely by the associated power spectrum, $P(k)$. 
Mass conservation formalism implies $\rho(\mathbf{x}, t) d\mathbf{x} = \rho_0 d\mathbf{q} $, so the density field at $t>0$ in terms of Lagrangian coordinates is given as 

\begin{equation}
 \rho(\mathbf{q}, t) = \rho_0 J \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial\mathbf{q}} \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

where the Jacobian $J \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial\mathbf{q}} \right]$ is calculated using Equation \ref{eq:ZA1}. Moreover, diagonalization of the resulting real, symmetric deformation tensor $d_{ij} = - \nabla_q \mathbf{s(q)} =  \partial^2 \psi(\mathbf{q})/ \partial q_i \partial q_j$ in terms of its eigenvalues $\lambda_1(\mathbf{q})$, $\lambda_2(\mathbf{q})$, $\lambda_3(\mathbf{q})$ gives the contraction or expansion along the three principal axes. This reduces the mass density to a convenient form:

\begin{equation}
 \rho(\mathbf{q}, t) = \frac{\rho_0}{ \left[1 - D(t) \lambda_1(\mathbf{q}) \right]\left[1 - D(t) \lambda_2(\mathbf{q}) \right]\left[1 - D(t) \lambda_3(\mathbf{q}) \right] }
\end{equation}

Since the deformation tensor $d_{ij}$ and its eigenvalues depend only on the initial density field, the ordered eigenvalues defined in Lagrangian space $\lambda_1(\mathbf{q}) \geq \lambda_2(\mathbf{q}) \geq \lambda_3(\mathbf{q})$ determine collapse condition for masses in Eulerian space (see \cite{Doroshkevich1973} and \cite{Lee1998} {for the PDFs  of the eigen values as well as several other parameters} in the case of Gaussian random fields). In the context of this paper, formation of caustics is of much interest: with increasing $D(t)$, the mass density rises until reaching singularity at $D(t) = 1/\lambda_3(\mathbf{q})$. In \hl{Lagrangian space, the caustics stem from these points and their counterparts  in Eulerian space} were proposed by Zel'dovich as the \hl{'birthplaces' of the first} collapsed structure by gravitational clustering. Now \hl{the regions bounded by the caustic surfaces} are referred to as {\it Zel'dovich pancakes}. The collapse along other principal axes correspond to formation of filaments and knots (\cite{Arnold1982}, \hl{Shandarin and Klypin (1984), however simultaneous collapses along all three eigen axes never happen in the case of generic flows.})

\caption{ This plot shows the idea of Lagrangian tessellations. Left: The distribution of Dark matter particles in Lagrangian space is on the regular grid. The tetrahedra surfaces in this case are mostly regular (except at the edges). Right panel shows the Eulerian positions of the same particles at $z=0$. The particles clearly have undergone multiple flip-flops, and the intersections of Lagrangian tetrahedra signifies locations of caustic surfaces. Specific tessellation schemes can be utilized separately to identify these surfaces. }

Furthermore, the analytical understanding of these structures are thoroughly complicated: In a 2-dimensional ZA, for example, there are 
\hl{only two types of fundamental singularities that exist at generic instants of time($A_2$, which are lines and $A_3$, which are the cusp points of $A_2$ lines).   In addition there are two singular points ($A_4$, and $D_4$) that exist  only at particular instants of time: at $A_4$ two cusp $A_3$-points are formed and a smooth part of an $A_2$ line is  transformed in self-crossing
line. Moreover there are  
 In addition there are several transient forms that exist only 
at particular times.}
Each of these correspond of formation, mergers, branching and other dynamical processes involving pancakes. \cite{Arnold1982} and \cite{Hidding2014} studied of singularities in 2-dimensional collapse) in exhaustive detail, but similar analytical characterization of 3-dimensional ZA has not been satisfactorily done yet.  
 
 
Complexities in 3-dimensional caustics is partly due the intricate mapping in the hypersurface $\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{q})$ called the Lagrangian submanifold (See Figure \ref{fig:Tess}). 
\hl{The Lagrangian submanifold $\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{q})$  is a single valued, smooth and differentiable function in it's 6-dimensional space $(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{x})$, however the projection onto 3-dimensional Eulerian space is entangled with creases, kinks and folds (Note that this  submanifold is very different than the phase space $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})$, even though they are connected by a cannonical transformation).} However, dilineating the Lagrangian submanifold reveals several properties of the dark matter dynamics not inferred from position-space analyses. Two fields related to tessellating the Lagrangian submanifold -- The Multistream field $n_{str}(\mathbf{x})$ in Eulerian space and the Flip-Flop field $n_{ff}(\mathbf{q})$ in Lagrangian space (check \cite{Shandarin2012}, \cite{Ramachandra2015}, \cite{Shandarin2016}) are closely related.
