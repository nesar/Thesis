abstract = {The boundaries of cold dark matter halos are commonly defined to enclose a density contrast {\$}\backslashDelta{\$} relative to a reference (mean or critical) density. We argue that a more physical boundary of halos is the radius at which accreted matter reaches its first orbital apocenter after turnaround. This splashback radius, {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$}, manifests itself as a sharp density drop in the halo outskirts, at a location that depends upon the mass accretion rate. We present calibrations of {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} and the enclosed mass, {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$}, as a function of the accretion rate and alternatively peak height. We find that {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} varies between {\$}\backslashapprox0.8-1R{\_}{\{}200m{\}}{\$} for rapidly accreting halos and {\$}\backslashapprox1.5R{\_}{\{}200m{\}}{\$} for slowly accreting halos. The extent of a halo and its associated environmental effects can thus extend well beyond the conventionally defined "virial" radius. We show that {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} and {\$}R{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} evolve relatively strongly compared to other commonly used definitions. In particular, {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} evolves significantly even for the smallest dwarf-sized halos at {\$}z=0{\$}. We also contrast {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} with the mass enclosed within four scale radii of the halo density profile, {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\textless}4rs{\}}{\$}, which characterizes the inner halo. During the early stages of halo assembly, {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\textless}4rs{\}}{\$} evolve similarly, but in the late stages {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\textless}4rs{\}}{\$} stops increasing while {\$}M{\_}{\{}sp{\}}{\$} continues to grow significantly. This illustrates that halos at low {\$}z{\$} can have "quiet" interiors while continuing to accrete mass in their outskirts. We discuss potential observational estimates of the splashback radius and show that it may already have been detected in galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We review the analysis of the Cosmic Web by means of an extensive toolset based on the use of Delaunay and Voronoi tessellations. The Cosmic Web is the salient and pervasive foamlike pattern in which matter has organized itself on scales of a few up to more than a hundred Megaparsec. First, we describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE). The DTFE formalism is shown to recover the hierarchical nature and the anisotropic morphology of the cosmic matter distribution. The Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) uses the DTFE density field to extract the diverse morphological elements - filaments, sheets and clusters - on the basis of a ScaleSpace analysis which searches for these morphologies over a range of scales. Subsequently, we discuss the Watershed Voidfinder (WVF), which invokes the discrete watershed transform to identify voids in the cosmic matter distribution. The WVF is able to determine the location, size and shape of the voids. The watershed transform is also a key element in the SpineWeb analysis of the cosmic matter distribution. It allows the determination of the filamentary spine and connected walls in the cosmic matter density field through the identification of the singularities and corresponding separatrices. Finally, we describe the concept of Alphashapes for assessing the topology of the cosmic matter distribution.},

abstract = {We describe a new algorithm for finding substructures within dark matter haloes from N-body simulations. The algorithm relies upon the fact that dynamically distinct substructures in a halo will have a {\{}$\backslash$em local{\}} velocity distribution that differs significantly from the mean, i.e. smooth background halo. We characterize the large-scale mean field using a coarsely grained cell-based approach, while a kernel smoothing process is used to determined the local velocity distribution. Comparing the ratio of these two estimates allows us to identify particles which are strongly cluster in velocity space relative to the background and thus resident in substructure. From this population of outliers, groups are identified using a Friends-of-Friends-like approach. False positives are rejected using Poisson noise arguments. This approach does not require a search of the full phase-space structure of a halo, a non-trivial task, and is thus computationally advantageous. We apply our algorithm to several test cases and show that it identifies not only subhaloes, bound overdensities in phase-space, but can recover tidal streams with a high purity. Our method can even find streams which do not appear significantly overdense in either physical or phase-space.},

abstract = {The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations of cosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we summarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": we investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak value of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes stems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent -- the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.},

Based on the watershed segmentation of the cosmic density field, the SpineWeb method invokes the local adjacency properties of the boundaries between the watershed basins to trace the critical points in the density field and the separatrices defined by them. The separatrices are classified into walls and the spine, the network of filaments and nodes in the matter distribution. Testing the method with a heuristic Voronoi model yields outstanding results. Following the discussion of the test results, we apply the SpineWeb method to a set of cosmological N-body simulations.

abstract = {Galaxies form in hierarchically assembling dark matter halos. With cosmological three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore in detail the virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with virial temperatures of 104 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that radius. With cooling, the virial shock position shrinks, and the filaments reach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures in protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of 2 from the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos, the gas reaches virial equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 3 in the cooling cases. This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and, interestingly, remains supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies, even in the absence of any feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3 orders of magnitude in length scale, with the turbulent pressure prevailing over the thermal energy. The turbulent velocity distributions are Maxwellian and by far dominate the small rotation velocities associated with the total angular momentum of the galaxies. Decomposing the velocity field using the Cauchy-Stokes theorem, we show that ample amounts of vorticity are present around shocks even at the very centers of these objects. In the cold flow regime of galaxy formation for halo masses below 1012 Msolar, this dominant role of virialization-driven turbulence should play an important role in star formation, as well as the build up of early magnetic fields.},

We create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clusters using surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxy surveys, X-ray luminosity, integrated Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal and lensing mass. The unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us to explore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with cluster mass. The scatter correlates between different mass-observable relations because of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation and environment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition of uncorrelated structure. We show that this can account for the apparent discrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal SZ signals measured for optically and X-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the Planck satellite. Related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clusters detected at high redshift. Our results illustrate that cosmological conclusions from galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only of the relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables and of the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures.},

abstract = {We study the shapes of subhalo distributions from four dark-matter-only simulations of Milky Way type haloes (Springel et al. 2008). The subhaloes have been identified by ten subhalo finders at up to five different resolution levels (Onions et al. 2012). Comparing the shapes derived from the subhalo distributions at high resolution to those of the underlying dark matter fields we find the former to be more triaxial if the analysis is restricted to massive subhaloes. For three of the four analysed haloes the increased triaxiality of the distributions of massive subhaloes can be explained by a systematic effect caused by the low number of objects. Subhaloes of the fourth halo show indications for anisotropic accretion via their strong triaxial distribution and orbit alignment with respect to the dark matter field. At low resolution levels the shape measurements of the subhalo distributions consisting of the 13 most massive objects identified by the different subhalo finders are strongly scattered. Comparing the shape of the observed Milky Way satellite distribution to those of high-resolution subhalo samples from simulations, we find an agreement for samples of bright satellites, but significant deviations if faint satellites are included in the analysis. These deviations might result from observational incompleteness.},

Environment defined only in terms of density fails to incorporate the intrinsic dynamics of each morphology. This plays an important role in both linear and non linear interactions between haloes. ii).- Most of the mass in the Universe is concentrated in filaments, narrowly followed by clusters. In terms of volume, clusters only represent a minute fraction, and filaments not more than 9{\%}.

abstract = {A new multi-dimensional Hierarchical Structure Finder (HSF) to study the phase-space structure of dark matter in N-body cosmological simulations is presented. The algorithm depends mainly on two parameters, which control the level of connectivity of the detected structures and their significance compared to Poisson noise. By working in 6D phase-space, where contrasts are much more pronounced than in 3D position space, our HSF algorithm is capable of detecting subhaloes including their tidal tails, and can recognise other phase-space structures such as pure streams and candidate caustics. If an additional unbinding criterion is added, the algorithm can be used as a self-consistent halo and subhalo finder. As a test, we apply it to a large halo of the Millennium Simulation, where 19 {\%} of the halo mass are found to belong to bound substructures, which is more than what is detected with conventional 3D substructure finders, and an additional 23-36 {\%} of the total mass belongs to unbound HSF structures. The distribution of identified phase-space density peaks is clearly bimodal: high peaks are dominated by the bound structures and low peaks belong mostly to tidal streams. In order to better understand what HSF provides, we examine the time evolution of structures, based on the merger tree history. Bound structures typically make only up to 6 orbits inside the main halo. Still, HSF can identify at the present time at least 80 {\%} of the original content of structures with a redshift of infall as high as z {\textless}= 0.3, which illustrates the significant power of this tool to perform dynamical analyses in phase-space.},

Percolation statistics is used here as a quantitative measure of the degree to which a mass or galaxy distribution is of a filamentary or cellular type. The very fast code used calculates the statistics of clusters along with the direct detection of percolation. We found that the two parameters mu(infinity), characterizing the size of the largest cluster, and mu-squared, characterizing the weighted mean size of all clusters excluding the largest one, are extremely useful for evaluating the percolation threshold. An advantage of using these parameters is their low sensitivity to boundary effects. We show that both the CDM and the C + HDM models are extremely filamentary both in mass and galaxy distribution. The percolation thresholds for the mass distributions are determined.},

abstract = {We present an exact general remeshing scheme to compute analytic integrals of polynomial functions over the intersections between convex polyhedral cells of old and new meshes. In physics applications this allows one to ensure global mass, momentum, and energy conservation while applying higher-order polynomial interpolation. We elaborate on applications of our algorithm arising in the analysis of cosmological N-body data, computer graphics, and continuum mechanics problems. We focus on the particular case of remeshing tetrahedral cells onto a Cartesian grid such that the volume integral of the polynomial density function given on the input mesh is guaranteed to equal the corresponding integral over the output mesh. We refer to this as "physically conservative voxelization". At the core of our method is an algorithm for intersecting two convex polyhedra by successively clipping one against the faces of the other. This algorithm is an implementation of the ideas presented abstractly by Sugihara (1994), who suggests using the planar graph representations of convex polyhedra to ensure topological consistency of the output. This makes our implementation robust to geometric degeneracy in the input. We employ a simplicial decomposition to calculate moment integrals up to quadratic order over the resulting intersection domain. We also address practical issues arising in a software implementation, including numerical stability in geometric calculations, management of cancellation errors, and extension to two dimensions. In a comparison to recent work, we show substantial performance gains. We provide a C implementation intended to be a fast, accurate, and robust tool for geometric calculations on polyhedral mesh elements.},

abstract = {We use a series of N-body simulations of the LCDM cosmology to investigate the redshift evolution since z=1 of the properties and alignment with the large-scale structure of haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids. We find that: (i) Once a rescaling of the halo mass with M*, the mass scale collapsing at redshift z, is performed, there is no further significant redshift dependence in the halo properties; (ii) The environment influences halo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with masses M{\textless}M*; and (iii) There is a significant alignment of both spin and shape of haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a) Haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*, halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M{\textgreater}M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters; c) Haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane independent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and haloes with M{\textgreater}M* perpendicular to it. For masses M{\textgreater}M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass scale M* sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS-environment either begins to affect, or reverses, the properties of dark matter haloes.},

We test our prediction by comparing with voids identified in the dark matter density field in N-body simulations using the ZOBOV void finder. This tests the extent to which the spherical evolution approximation, which forms the basis of the analytical predictions, models the highly aspherical voids that occur in the cosmic web, and are found by a watershed-based algorithm such as ZOBOV. We show that the volume function returned by ZOBOV is quite sensitive to the choice of treatment of sub-voids, a fact that has not been appreciated previously. For reasonable choices of sub-void exclusion, we find that the Lagrangian density deltav of the ZOBOV voids -- which is predicted to be a constant deltav=-2.7 in the spherical evolution model -- is quite different from the predicted value, showing substantial scatter and scale dependence. Our analytical approximations are flexible enough to give a good description of the resulting volume function; however, this happens for choices of parameter values that are different from those suggested by the spherical evolution assumption. We conclude that analytical models for voids must move away from the spherical approximation in order to be applied successfully to observations, and we discuss some possible ways forward.},

Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct primordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe physics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an unconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on at least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any scale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two species at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how the primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are progressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in that of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low redshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of baryons and DM differs by ˜2 per cent at z = 9 and by 0.2 per cent at z = 0. The differences in the amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10 per cent at z = 9 and 1 per cent at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects expected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the power spectrum and the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected, given the precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. Hence, our results validate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distribution using predictions for the total mass clustering in the Universe.},

We compare our result to the popular subhalo finder SUBFIND and show that this Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code is able to well resolve subhalos in high density environment and keep strict physical track of subhalos' merger history. HBT also features fast speed as it does not need density interpolation or spatial searching when constructing source subhalos, and because it is fully parallelized.

The conversions are efficient when the mass eigenstates are well-separated in space but suppressed if their wave-packets overlap; the suppression is most severe for mass-degenerate eigenstates in flat space-time.

abstract = {Dark matter numerical simulations and the N-body method are essential for understanding how structure forms and evolves in the Universe. However, the discrete nature of N-body simulations can affect its accuracy when modelling collisionless systems. We introduce a new approach to simulate the gravitational evolution of cold collisionless fluids by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in terms of adaptively refineable "Lagrangian phase space elements". These geometrical elements are piecewise smooth maps between three-dimensional Lagrangian space and six-dimensional Eulerian phase space and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function. They allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to follow the evolution even in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss various test problems which demonstrate the correctness and performance of our method. We show that it has several advantages compared to standard N-body algorithms by i) explicitly tracking the fine-grained distribution function, ii) naturally representing caustics, iii) providing an arbitrarily regular density field defined everywhere in space, iv) giving a smooth and regular gravitational potential field, thus eliminating the need for any type of ad-hoc force softening. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of using our method for cosmological studies by simulating structure formation in a warm dark matter cosmology. We show that spurious collisionality and discreteness noise of N-body methods are both strongly suppressed, which eliminates artificial fragmentation of filaments while providing access to the full deterministic evolution of the fluid in phase space. Therefore, we argue that our new approach improves on the N-body method when simulating self-gravitating cold and collisionless fluids, and is the first method that allows to explicitly follow the fine-grained evolution in six-dimensional phase space.},

abstract = {The cosmic web is the largest scale manifestation of the anisotropic gravitational collapse of matter. It represents the transitional stage between linear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information about the early phases of structure formation processes. Here we investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components. Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis identifies clusters and filaments as the most prominent components of the web. In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present-day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into walls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than 100 h-1 Mpc. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to form along approximatively straight lines.},

It compares SPH methods to 6D Delaunay tessellation on statical and dynamical realisation of single halo profiles, paying attention to the unknown scaling, S{\_}G, used to relate the spatial dimensions to the velocity dimensions. The methods with local adaptive metric provide the best phase-space estimators. They make use of a Shannon entropy criterion combined with a binary tree partitioning and with SPH interpolation using 10-40 neighbours. Local scaling implemented by such methods, which enforces local isotropy of the distribution function, can vary by about one order of magnitude in different regions within the system. It presents a bimodal distribution, in which one component is dominated by the main part of the halo and the other one is dominated by the substructures. While potentially better than SPH techniques, since it yields an optimal estimate of the local softening volume (and the local number of neighbours required to perform the interpolation), the Delaunay tessellation in fact poorly estimates the phase-space distribution function. Indeed, it requires, the choice of a global scaling S{\_}G. We propose two methods to estimate S{\_}G that yield a good global compromise. However, the Delaunay interpolation still remains quite sensitive to local anisotropies in the distribution. We also compare 6D phase-space density estimation with the proxy, Q=rho/sigma{\^{}}3, where rho is the local density and 3 sigma{\^{}}2 is the local 3D velocity dispersion. We show that Q only corresponds to a rough approximation of the true phase-space density, and is not able to capture all the details of the distribution in phase-space, ignoring, in particular, filamentation and tidal streams.},

abstract = {Using cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and gravitational forces, we investigate the influence of photoionization by a UV radiation background on the formation of galaxies. In our highest resolution simulations, we find that photoionization has essentially no effect on the baryonic mass function of galaxies at {\$}z=2{\$}, down to our resolution limit of {\$}5e9 M{\_}\backslashsun{\$}. We do, however, find a strong interplay between the mass resolution of a simulation and the microphysics included in the computation of heating and cooling rates. At low resolution, a photoionizing background can appear to suppress the formation of even relatively massive galaxies. However, when the same initial conditions are evolved with a factor of eight better mass resolution, this effect disappears. Our results demonstrate the need for care in interpreting the results of cosmological simulations that incorporate hydrodynamics and radiation physics. For example, we conclude that a simulation with limited resolution may yield more realistic results if it ignores some relevant physical processes, such as photoionization. At higher resolution, the simulated population of massive galaxies is insensitive to the treatment of photoionization and star formation, but it does depend significantly on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations. By {\$}z=2{\$}, an {\$}\backslashOmega=1{\$} cold dark matter model normalized to produce the observed masses of present-day clusters has already formed galaxies with baryon masses exceeding {\$}1e11 M{\_}\backslashsun{\$}.},

abstract = {We present the Cosmic Web Detachment (CWD) model, a conceptual framework to interpret galaxy evolution in a cosmological context, providing a direct link between the star formation history of galaxies and the cosmic web. The CWD model unifies several mechanism known to disrupt or stop star formation into one single physical process and provides a natural explanation for a wide range of galaxy properties. Galaxies begin accreting star-forming gas at early times via a network of primordial highly coherent filaments. The efficient star formation phase ends when non-linear interactions with other galaxies or elements of the cosmic web detach the galaxy from its network of primordial filaments, thus ending the efficient accretion of cold gas. The stripping of the filamentary web around galaxies is the physical process responsible of star formation quenching in gas stripping, harassment, strangulation and starvation. Being a purely gravitational/mechanical process CWD acts at a more fundamental level than internal feedback processes. We introduce a simple and efficient formalism to identify CWD events in N-body simulations. With it we reproduce and explain, in the context of CWD, several key observations including downsizing, the cosmic star formation rate history, the galaxy mass-color diagram and the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies with mass and local density.},

abstract = {We analyze the structure and connectivity of the distinct morphologies that define the Cosmic Web. With the help of our Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF), we dissect the matter distribution of a cosmological {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM N-body computer simulation into cluster, filaments and walls. The MMF is ideally suited to adress both the anisotropic morphological character of filaments and sheets, as well as the multiscale nature of the hierarchically evolved cosmic matter distribution. The results of our study may be summarized as follows: i).- While all morphologies occupy a roughly well defined range in density, this alone is not sufficient to differentiate between them given their overlap. Environment defined only in terms of density fails to incorporate the intrinsic dynamics of each morphology. This plays an important role in both linear and non linear interactions between haloes. ii).- Most of the mass in the Universe is concentrated in filaments, narrowly followed by clusters. In terms of volume, clusters only represent a minute fraction, and filaments not more than 9{\%}. Walls are relatively inconspicous in terms of mass and volume. iii).- On average, massive clusters are connected to more filaments than low mass clusters. Clusters with {\$}M \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} h{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} have on average two connecting filaments, while clusters with {\$}M \backslashgeq 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} h{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} have on average five connecting filaments. iv).- Density profiles indicate that the typical width of filaments is 2{\$}\backslashMpch{\$}.

Massive clusters are often highly elongated in the direction of the filaments connected to them and along which most merging clumps are moving in (van Haarlem {\&} van deWey- gaert 1993). 


Walls: identification is a major challenge (Shandarin et al. 2004), and their tenuous nature and complex topology and shapes make them the most difficult morphology to characterize.

While type 1 AGN, owing to their bright and unobscured nature, are easy to detect and constitute a rather complete and unbiased sample, their type 2 counterparts, postulated by AGN unification, are not as straightforward to identify. Matching the WISE catalog with known QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we confirm previous identification of the type 1 locus in the WISE color space. Using a very large database of the popular CLUMPY torus models, we find the colors of the putative type 2 counterparts, and also, for the first time, predict their number vs. flux relation that can be expected to be observed in any given WISE color range. This will allow us to put statistically very significant constraints on the torus parameters. Our results are a successful test of the AGN unification scheme.},

abstract = {The primordial velocity dispersion of dark matter is small compared to the velocities attained during structure formation. The initial density distribution is close to uniform, and it occupies an initial sheet in phase space that is single valued in velocity space. Because of gravitational forces, this 3D manifold evolves in phase space without ever tearing, conserving phase-space volume and preserving the connectivity of nearby points. N-body simulations already follow the motion of this sheet in phase space. This fact can be used to extract full fine-grained phase-space structure information from existing cosmological N-body simulations. Particles are considered as the vertices of an unstructured 3D mesh moving in 6D phase space. On this mesh, mass density and momentum are uniquely defined. We show how to obtain the space density of the fluid, detect caustics and count the number of streams as well as their individual contributions to any point in configuration space. We calculate the bulk velocity, local velocity dispersions and densities from the sheet - all without averaging over control volumes. This gives a wealth of new information about dark matter fluid flow which had previously been thought of as inaccessible to N-body simulations. We outline how this mapping may be used to create new accurate collisionless fluid simulation codes that may be able to overcome the sparse sampling and unphysical two-body effects that plague current N-body techniques.},

abstract = {On megaparsec scales the Universe is permeated by an intricate filigree of clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, the Cosmic Web. For the understanding of its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is that of the dominant underdense Voids, the product of a hierarchical process driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones. In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the Watershed Void Finder (WVF), is based upon the Watershed Transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling noise. This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on a set of Kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low noise and high noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the voids are succesfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void size distribution function.},

Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {The microphysical properties of the DM particle can, in principle, be constrained by the properties and abundance of substructures in DM halos, as measured through strong gravitational lensing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of accurate theoretical predictions for the lensing signal of substructures, mainly because of the discreteness noise inherent to N-body simulations. Here we present Recursive-TCM, a method that is able to provide lensing predictions with an arbitrarily low discreteness noise, without any free parameters or smoothing scale. This solution is based on a novel way of interpreting the results of N-body simulations, where particles simply trace the evolution and distortion of Lagrangian phase-space volume elements. We discuss the advantages of this method over the widely used cloud-in-cells and adaptive-kernel smoothing density estimators. Applying the new method to a cluster-sized DM halo simulated in warm and cold DM scenarios, we show how the expected differences in their substructure population translate into differences in the convergence and magnification maps. We anticipate that our method will provide the high-precision theoretical predictions required to interpret and fully exploit strong gravitational lensing observations.},

While applications will differ in specific exploits, we believe that such a design process will become increasingly important in the future.

abstract = {We present the results of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), a ten-year project to map the full three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe. The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly a million galaxies with Ks {\textless}= 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5° for bright galaxies. Near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with Ks {\textless}= 11.75 mag and |b| {\textgreater}= 5° ({\textgreater}=8° toward the Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a redshift catalog that is 97.6{\%} complete to well-defined limits and covers 91{\%} of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity fields out to 50 h -1 Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies with Ks {\textless}= 11.25 mag and |b| {\textgreater}= 10°.},

abstract = {We present vide, the Void IDentification and Examination toolkit, an open-source Python/C++ code for finding cosmic voids in galaxy redshift surveys and N-body simulations, characterizing their properties, and providing a platform for more detailed analysis. At its core, vide uses a substantially enhanced version of zobov (Neyinck 2008) to calculate a Voronoi tessellation for estimating the density field and performing a watershed transform to construct voids. Additionally, vide provides significant functionality for both pre- and post-processing: for example, vide can work with volume- or magnitude-limited galaxy samples with arbitrary survey geometries, or dark matter particles or halo catalogs in a variety of common formats. It can also randomly subsample inputs and includes a Halo Occupation Distribution model for constructing mock galaxy populations. vide uses the watershed levels to place voids in a hierarchical tree, outputs a summary of void properties in plain ASCII, and provides a Python API to perform many analysis tasks, such as loading and manipulating void catalogs and particle members, filtering, plotting, computing clustering statistics, stacking, comparing catalogs, and fitting density profiles. While centered around ZOBOV, the toolkit is designed to be as modular as possible and accommodate other void finders. vide has been in development for several years and has already been used to produce a wealth of results, which we summarize in this work to highlight the capabilities of the toolkit. vide is publicly available at http://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide{\_}public and http://www.cosmicvoids.net.},

The results obtained demonstrate that the two clusters are embedded in a common supercluster of very large extent. It is found that there are three observationally distinct populations of galaxies within this supercluster, including galaxies located in the two rich cluster cores, those located in intermediate- or low-mass clusters, and a nearly homogeneously distributed population of isolated galaxies; in addition, a population of foreground galaxies located in low-mass clusters rather than being distributed in a homogeneous 'field' is also identified. The redshift of formation for the foreground groups is estimated to be no more than about 9, and the morphology of the galaxies is examined. It is suggested that every nearby very rich cluster is located in a supercluster and that all clusters of richness class greater than or equal to 2 will eventually be found to lie in superclusters.},

abstract = {We present the first and so far the only simulations to follow the fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic $\Lambda$ cold dark matter initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these methods to the six Milky Way mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from the halo centre, a typical point intersects about 1014 streams with a very broad range of individual densities; the ˜106 most-massive streams contribute about half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most-massive fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1 per cent of the total signal. Dark matter particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the big bang, with a 5-95 per cent range of 50-500. Such caustic counts are a measure of the total amount of dynamical mixing and are very robustly determined by our technique. The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a negligible boost ({\textless}0.1 per cent) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate. The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10 per cent. Thus, fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the detectability of the dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories or indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most-massive local fine-grained streams because of their extreme localization in the energy-momentum space.},

The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

abstract = {The existence of critical points for the peculiar velocity field is a natural feature of the correlated vector field. These points appear in contact zones of the velocity domains with different orientation of the averaged velocity vector. At the same time peculiar velocities are the cause of the scatter of the Hubble expansion rate. We propose that a more precise determination of the Hubble constant can be made by restricting analysis to subsample of observational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the peculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On large-scales the critical points where the first derivative of the gravitational potential vanishes can be easily identified using the density field and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational potential. We use high- resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions are stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially minimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of vanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging indiscriminately using the full data sets as is the common approach. This could help to reconcile the CMB-measured value of the Hubble constant with that obtained from the local measurements.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

These parameters are defined as the rotational invariant coefficients of the characteristic equation of the tensor. In the nonlinear local model (NLM) where the magnetic part of Weyl tensor vanishes, these invariants are fully capable of characterizing the dynamics. Unlike the Zeldovich approximation (ZA), where various morphologies do not change before approaching a one-dimensional singularity, the sheets in NLM are unstable for both overdense and underdense perturbations. While it has long been known that the coupling between tidal tensor and velocity shear would cause a filamentary final configuration of a collapsing region, we show that the underdense perturbation are more subtle, as the balance between the shear rate (tidal force) and the divergence (density) could lead to different morphologies. Interestingly, this instability also sets the basis for understanding some distinctions of the cosmic web identified dynamically and kinematically. We show that the sheets with negative density perturbation in the potential based algorithm would turn to filaments faster than in the kinematic method, which could explain the distorted dynamical filamentary structure observed in the simulation.},

abstract = {We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P(k) from over 200,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with WMAP and other data. Our results are consistent with a ``vanilla'' flat adiabatic Lambda-CDM model without tilt (n=1), running tilt, tensor modes or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 sigma constraints on the Hubble parameter from h{\~{}}0.74+0.18-0.07 to h{\~{}}0.70+0.04-0.03, on the matter density from Omega{\_}m{\~{}}0.25+/-0.10 to Omega{\_}m{\~{}}0.30+/-0.04 (1 sigma) and on neutrino masses from {\textless}11 eV to {\textless}0.6 eV (95{\%}). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis of WMAP and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, which is an impressive consistency check with independent redshift survey data and analysis techniques. In this paper, we place particular emphasis on clarifying the physical origin of the constraints, i.e., what we do and do not know when using different data sets and prior assumptions. For instance, dropping the assumption that space is perfectly flat, the WMAP-only constraint on the measured age of the Universe tightens from t0{\~{}}16.3+2.3-1.8 Gyr to t0{\~{}}14.1+1.0-0.9 Gyr by adding SDSS and SN Ia data. Including tensors, running tilt, neutrino mass and equation of state in the list of free parameters, many constraints are still quite weak, but future cosmological measurements from SDSS and other sources should allow these to be substantially tightened.},

abstract = {We study the formation of dark matter halos in the concordance LCDM model over a wide range of redshifts, from z=20 to the present. Our primary focus is the halo mass function, a key probe of cosmology. By performing a large suite of nested-box N-body simulations with careful convergence and error controls (60 simulations with box sizes from 4 to 256 Mpc/h, we determine the mass function and its evolution with excellent statistical and systematic errors, reaching a few percent over most of the considered redshift and mass range. Across the studied redshifts, the halo mass is probed over 6 orders of magnitude (10{\^{}}7 - 10{\^{}}13.5 M{\_}sun/h). Historically, there has been considerable variation in the high redshift mass function as obtained by different groups. We have made a concerted effort to identify and correct possible systematic errors in computing the mass function at high redshift and to explain the discrepancies between some of the previous results. We discuss convergence criteria for the required force resolution, simulation box size, halo mass range, initial and final redshift, and time stepping. Because of conservative cuts on the mass range probed by individual boxes, our results are relatively insensitive to simulation volume, the remaining sensitivity being consistent with extended Press-Schechter theory. Previously obtained mass function fits near z=0, when scaled by linear theory, are in good agreement with our results at all redshifts, although a mild redshift dependence consistent with that found by Reed and collaborators exists at low redshifts.},

abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5×10 7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

abstract = {We describe a new method (HOP) for identifying groups of particles in N-body simulations. Having assigned to every particle an estimate of its local density, we associate each particle with the densest of the Nhop particles nearest to it. Repeating this process allows us to trace a path, within the particle set itself, from each particle in the direction of increasing density. The path ends when it reaches a particle that is its own densest neighbor; all particles reaching the same such particle are identified as a group. Combined with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straightforward. One can proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour. While the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen parameters, we show that the results are insensitive to most of these, the exception being the outer density cutoff of the groups.},

We use ORIGAMI to determine the cosmic web morphology of each dark matter particle in a suite of cosmological {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, which explicitly calculates whether a particle has crossed paths with others along multiple sets of axes and does not depend on a parameter or smoothing scale. The theoretical picture of voids is that of expanding underdensities with borders defined by shell-crossing. We find instead that locally underdense single-stream regions are not bounded on all sides by multi-stream regions, thus they percolate, filling the simulation volume; we show that the set of multi-stream particles also percolates. This percolation persists to high resolution, where the mass fraction of single-stream voids is low, because the volume fraction remains high; we speculate on the fraction of collapsed mass in the continuum limit of infinite resolution. By introducing a volume threshold parameter to define underdense void "cores", we create a catalog of ORIGAMI voids which consist entirely of single-stream particles and measure their percolation properties, volume functions, and average densities.},

abstract = {Warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies are a viable alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) scenario. Unfortunately, an accurate scrutiny of the WDM predictions with N-body simulations has proven difficult due to numerical artefacts. Here, we report on cosmological simulations that, for the first time, are devoid of those problems, and thus are able to accurately resolve the WDM halo mass function well below the cut-off. We discover a complex picture, with perturbations at different evolutionary stages populating different ranges in the halo mass function. On the smallest mass scales we can resolve, identified objects are typically centres of filaments that are starting to collapse. On intermediate mass scales, objects typically correspond to fluctuations that have collapsed and are in the process of relaxation, whereas the high-mass end is dominated by objects similar to haloes identified in CDM simulations. We then explicitly show how the formation of low-mass haloes is suppressed, which translates into a strong cut-off in the halo mass function. This disfavours some analytic formulations that predict a halo mass function that would extend well below the free streaming mass. We argue for a more detailed exploration of the formation of the smallest structures expected to form in a given cosmology, which, we foresee, will advance our overall understanding of structure formation.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the number density of voids in the dark matter distribution from a series of N-body simulations of a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology. We define voids as spherical regions of $\rho$v = 0.2$\rho$m around density minima in order to relate our results to the predicted abundances using the excursion set formalism. Using a linear underdensity of $\delta$v = −2.7, from a spherical evolution model, we find that a volume-conserving model, which does not conserve number density in the mapping from the linear to non-linear regime, matches the measured abundance to within 16 per cent for a range of void radii 1 {\textless} r(h−1 Mpc) {\textless} 15. This model fixes the volume fraction of the universe which is in voids and assumes that voids of a similar size merge as they expand by a factor of 1.7 to achieve a non-linear density of $\rho$v = 0.2$\rho$m today. We find that the model of Sheth and van de Weygaert for the number density of voids greatly overpredicts the abundances over the same range of scales. We find that the volume-conserving model works well at matching the number density of voids measured from the simulations at higher redshifts, z = 0.5 and 1, as well as correctly predicting the abundances to within 25 per cent in a simulation of a matter dominated $\Omega$m = 1 universe. We examine the abundance of voids in the halo distribution and find fewer small, r {\textless} 10 h−1 Mpc, voids and many more large, r {\textgreater} 10 h−1 Mpc, voids compared to the dark matter. These results indicate that voids identified in the halo or galaxy distribution are related to the underlying void distribution in the dark matter in a complicated way which merits further study if voids are to be used as a precision probe of cosmology.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of predicting the halo mass function from the properties of the Lagrangian density field. We focus on a perturbation spectrum with a small-scale cut-off (as in warm dark matter cosmologies). This cut-off results in a strong suppression of low mass objects, providing additional leverage to rigorously test which perturbations collapse and to what mass. We find that all haloes are consistent with forming near peaks of the initial density field, with a strong correlation between proto-halo density and ellipticity. We demonstrate that, while standard excursion set theory with correlated steps completely fails to reproduce the mass function, the inclusion of the peaks constraint leads to the correct number of haloes but significantly underpredicts the masses of low-mass objects (with the predicted halo mass function at low masses behaving like dn/dln m {\~{}} m{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}). This prediction is very robust and cannot be easily altered within the framework of a single collapse barrier. The nature of collapse in the presence of a small-scale cut-off thus reveals that excursion set calculations require a more detailed understanding of the collapse-time of a general ellipsoidal perturbation to predict the ultimate collapsed mass of a peak -- a problem that has been hidden in the large abundance of small-scale structure in CDM. We demonstrate how this problem can be resolved within the excursion set framework.},

abstract = {The Press-Schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, $\delta$sc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that $\delta$sc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this $\delta$ec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.},

abstract = {We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological "zoom-in" simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first (1LPT) or second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves RMS relative errors of order 10{\^{}}(-4) for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real space based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.},

abstract = {The Field Estimator for Arbitrary Spaces (FiEstAS) computes the continuous probability density field underlying a given discrete data sample in multiple, non-commensurate dimensions. The algorithm works by constructing a metric-independent tessellation of the data space based on a recursive binary splitting. Individual, data-driven bandwidths are assigned to each point, scaled so that a constant "mass" M0 is enclosed. Kernel density estimation may then be performed for different kernel shapes, and a combination of balloon and sample point estimators is proposed as a compromise between resolution and variance. A bias correction is evaluated for the particular (yet common) case where the density is computed exactly at the locations of the data points rather than at an uncorrelated set of locations. By default, the algorithm combines a top-hat kernel with M0 = 2.0 with the balloon estimator and applies the corresponding bias correction. These settings are shown to yield reasonable results for a simple test case, a two-dimensional ring, that illustrates the performance for oblique distributions, as well as for a six-dimensional Hernquist sphere, a fairly realistic model of the dynamical structure of stellar bulges in galaxies and dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations. Results for different parameter settings are discussed in order to provide a guideline to select an optimal configuration in other cases. Source code is available upon request. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We then extend the MHF code in order to track the orbital evolution of gravitationally bound objects through any given cosmological N-body simulation - our so-called `MLAPM halo tracker' (MHT). The mode of operation of MHT is demonstrated using a series of eight high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy clusters. Each of these haloes hosts more than one million particles within their virial radii rvir. We use MHT as well as MHF to follow the temporal evolution of hundreds of individual satellites, and show that the radial distribution of these substructure satellites follows a `universal' radial distribution irrespective of the environment and formation history of the host halo. This in fact might pose another problem for simulations of cold dark matter structure formation, as there are recent findings by Taylor, Silk {\&} Babul that the Milky Way satellites are found preferentially closer to the Galactic Centre and simulations underestimate the amount of central substructure. Further, this universal substructure profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. The halo finder MHF will become part of the open source MLAPM distribution.},

abstract = {We present analysis of the evolution of dark matter halos in dense environments of groups and clusters in dissipationless cosmological simulations. The premature destruction of halos in such environments, known as the overmerging, reduces the predictive power of N-body simulations and makes difficult any comparison between models and observations. We analyze the possible processes that cause the overmerging and assess the extent to which this problem can be cured with current computer resources and codes. Using both analytic estimates and high-resolution numerical simulations, we argue that the overmerging is mainly due to the lack of numerical resolution. We find that the force and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in galaxy groups and clusters is extremely high and was almost never reached before: {\~{}}1-3 kpc and 108-109 M☉, respectively. We use the high-resolution Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART) N-body code to run cosmological simulations with particle mass ≈2 × 108 h-1 M☉ and spatial resolution ≈1-2 h-1 kpc and show that in these simulations the halos do survive in regions that would appear overmerged with lower force resolution. Nevertheless, the halo identification in very dense environments remains a challenge even with resolution this high. We present two new halo-finding algorithms developed to identify both isolated and satellite halos that are stable (existed at previous moments) and gravitationally bound. To illustrate the use of the satellite halos that survive the overmerging, we present a series of halo statistics, which can be compared with those of observed galaxies. Particularly, we find that, on average, halos in groups have the same velocity dispersion as the dark matter particles; i.e., they do not exhibit significant velocity bias. The small-scale (100 kpc to 1 Mpc) halo correlation function in both models is well described by the power law $\xi$  r-1.7 and is in good agreement with observations. It is slightly antibiased (b≈0.7-0.9) relative to the dark matter. To test other galaxy statistics, we use the maximum of the halo rotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation to assign luminosity to the halos. For two cosmological models, a flat model with the cosmological constant and $\Omega$0=1-$\Omega$$\Lambda$=0.3,h=0.7 and a model with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter and $\Omega$0=1.0,$\Omega$$\nu$=0.2,h=0.5, we construct luminosity functions and evaluate mass-to-light ratios in groups. Both models produce luminosity functions and mass-to-light ratios ( {\~{}}200-400) that are in reasonable agreement with observations. The latter implies that the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy groups (at least for Mvir  3 × 1013 h-1 M☉ analyzed here) is not a good indicator of $\Omega$0.},

abstract = {We report the results of the first study of the multi-stream environment of dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations in the LCDM cosmology. The full dynamical state of dark matter can be described as a three-dimensional sub-manifold in six dimensional phase space - the dark matter sheet. In our study we use a Lagrangian sub-manifold x = x(q,t) (where x and q are co-moving Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates respectively), which is dynamically equivalent to the dark matter sheet but is more convenient for numerical analysis. Our major results can be summarized as follows. At the resolution of the simulation i.e. without additional smoothing, the cosmic web represents a hierarchical structure: each halo is embedded in the filamentary framework of the web predominantly at the filament crossings, and each filament is embedded in the wall like fabric of the web at the wall crossings. Locally, each halo or sub-halo is a peak in the number of streams field. The number of streams in the neighbouring filaments is higher than in the neighbouring walls. The walls are regions where number of streams is equal to three or a few. Voids are uniquely defined by the local condition requiring to be a single-stream flow region. The shells of streams around haloes are quite thin and the closest void region is typically within one and a half FOF radius from the center of the halo.},

abstract = {We study evolution of voids in cosmological simulations using a new method for tracing voids over cosmic time. The method is based on tracking watershed basins (contiguous regions around density minima) of well developed voids at low redshift, on a regular grid of density field. It enables us to construct a robust and continuous mapping between voids at different redshifts, from initial conditions to the present time. We discuss how the new approach eliminates strong spurious effects of numerical origin when voids evolution is traced by matching voids between successive snapshots (by analogy to halo merger trees). We apply the new method to a cosmological simulation of a standard LambdaCDM cosmological model and study evolution of basic properties of typical voids (with effective radii between 6Mpc/h and 20Mpc/h at redshift z=0) such as volumes, shapes, matter density distributions and relative alignments. The final voids at low redshifts appear to retain a significant part of the configuration acquired in initial conditions. Shapes of voids evolve in a collective way which barely modifies the overall distribution of the axial ratios. The evolution appears to have a weak impact on mutual alignments of voids implying that the present state is in large part set up by the primordial density field. We present evolution of dark matter density profiles computed on iso-density surfaces which comply with the actual shapes of voids. Unlike spherical density profiles, this approach enables us to demonstrate development of theoretically predicted bucket-like shape of the final density profiles indicating a wide flat core and a sharp transition to high-density void walls.},

abstract = {Recently, we have shown how current cosmological N-body codes already follow the fine grained phase-space information of the dark matter fluid. Using a tetrahedral tesselation of the three-dimensional manifold that describes perfectly cold fluids in six-dimensional phase space, the phase-space distribution function can be followed throughout the simulation. This allows one to project the distribution function into configuration space to obtain highly accurate densities, velocities, and velocity dispersions. Here, we exploit this technique to show first steps on how to devise an improved particle-mesh technique. At its heart, the new method thus relies on a piecewise linear approximation of the phase space distribution function rather than the usual particle discretisation. We use pseudo-particles that approximate the masses of the tetrahedral cells up to quadrupolar order as the locations for cloud-in-cell (CIC) deposit instead of the particle locations themselves as in standard CIC deposit. We demonstrate that this modification already gives much improved stability and more accurate dynamics of the collisionless dark matter fluid at high force and low mass resolution. We demonstrate the validity and advantages of this method with various test problems as well as hot/warm-dark matter simulations which have been known to exhibit artificial fragmentation. This completely unphysical behaviour is much reduced in the new approach. The current limitations of our approach are discussed in detail and future improvements are outlined.},

In addition to describing the evolution of the dark matter itself, the model allows one to describe the evolution of the Eulerian space distribution of the haloes. It can also be used to describe density profiles, on scales larger than the virial radius, of these haloes, and to quantify the way in which matter flows in and out of Eulerian cells. When the initial Lagrangian space distribution is white noise Gaussian, the model suggests that the Inverse Gaussian distribution should provide a reasonably good approximation to the evolved Eulerian density field, in agreement with numerical simulations. Application of this model to clustering from more general Gaussian initial conditions is discussed at the end.},

Because of the recent increased interest in voids, both in very large galaxy surveys and in detailed simulations of cosmic structure formation, this situation is very unfortunate. We here present the first systematic comparison study of thirteen different void finders constructed using particles, haloes, and semi-analytical model galaxies extracted from a subvolume of the Millennium simulation. The study includes many groups that have studied voids over the past decade. We show their results and discuss their differences and agreements. As it turns out, the basic results of the various methods agree very well with each other in that they all locate a major void near the centre of our volume. Voids have very underdense centres, reaching below 10 percent of the mean cosmic density. In addition, those void finders that allow for void galaxies show that those galaxies follow similar trends. For example, the overdensity of void galaxies brighter than mB = -20 is found to be smaller than about -0.8 by all our void finding algorithms.},

abstract = {Context: In the past decade or so, using numerical N-body simulations to describe the gravitational clustering of dark matter (DM) in an expanding universe has become the tool of choice for tackling the issue of hierarchical galaxy formation. As mass resolution increases with the power of supercomputers, one is able to grasp finer and finer details of this process, resolving more and more of the inner structure of collapsed objects. This begs one to revisit time and again the post-processing tools with which one transforms particles into ``invisible'' dark matter haloes and from thereon into luminous galaxies. Aims: Although a fair amount of work has been devoted to growing Monte-Carlo merger trees that resemble those built from an N-body simulation, comparatively little effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarily encounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation. To somewhat revert the tide, this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive study of the problems one faces when following this route. Methods: The first step in building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by the simulation. Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an algorithm (called AdaptaHOP) in this paper, we believe that our results do not depend on the exact details of the implementation but instead extend to most if not all (sub)structure finders. To illustrate this point in the appendix we compare AdaptaHOP's results to the standard friend-of-friend (FOF) algorithm, widely utilised in the astrophysical community. We then highlight different ways of building merger histories from AdaptaHOP haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their various advantages and drawbacks. Results: We find that the best approach to (sub)halo merging histories is through an analysis that goes back and forth between identification and tree building rather than one that conducts a straightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. This is rooted in the complexity of the merging trees that have to depict an inherently dynamical process from the partial temporal information contained in the collection of instantaneous snapshots available from the N-body simulation. However, we also propose a simpler sequential ``Most massive Substructure Method'' (MSM) whose trees approximate those obtained via the more complicated non sequential method.

abstract = {Understanding the velocity field is very important for modern cosmology: it gives insights to structure formation in general, and also its properties are crucial ingredients in modelling redshift-space distortions and in interpreting measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Unfortunately, characterising the velocity field in cosmological N-body simulations is inherently complicated by two facts: i) The velocity field becomes manifestly multi-valued after shell-crossing and has discontinuities at caustics. This is due to the collisionless nature of dark matter. ii) N-body simulations sample the velocity field only at a set of discrete locations, with poor resolution in low-density regions. In this paper, we discuss how the associated problems can be circumvented by using a phase-space interpolation technique. This method provides extremely accurate estimates of the cosmic velocity fields and its derivatives, which can be properly defined without the need of the arbitrary "coarse-graining" procedure commonly used. We explore in detail the configuration-space properties of the cosmic velocity field on very large scales and in the highly nonlinear regime. In particular, we characterise the divergence and curl of the velocity field, present their one-point statistics, analyse the Fourier-space properties and provide fitting formulae for the velocity divergence bias relative to the non-linear matter power spectrum. We furthermore contrast some of the interesting differences in the velocity fields of warm and cold dark matter models. We anticipate that the high-precision measurements carried out here will help to understand in detail the dynamics of dark matter and the structures it forms.},

abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\^{}}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\^{}}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of the substructure properties of a single Milky Way sized dark matter halo from the Aquarius suite at five different resolutions, as identified by a variety of different (sub-)halo finders for simulations of cosmic structure formation. These finders span a wide range of techniques and methodologies to extract and quantify substructures within a larger non-homogeneous background density (e.g. a host halo). This includes real-space, phase-space, velocity-space and time- space based finders, as well as finders employing a Voronoi tessellation, friends-of-friends techniques, or refined meshes as the starting point for locating substructure.A common post-processing pipeline was used to uniformly analyse the particle lists provided by each finder. We extract quantitative and comparable measures for the subhaloes, primarily focusing on mass and the peak of the rotation curve for this particular study. We find that all of the finders agree extremely well on the presence and location of substructure and even for properties relating to the inner part part of the subhalo (e.g. the maximum value of the rotation curve). For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the subhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that basic properties (mass, maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably recovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence can be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20. We finally note that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is remarkably consistent and {\textless}1 for all the finders that reached high resolution. If correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively, substructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of the (sub-)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.},

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for identifying ellipsoidal haloes in numerical simulations, and quantify how the resulting estimates of halo mass and shape differ with respect to spherical halo finders. Haloes become more prolate when fit with ellipsoids, the difference being most pronounced for the more aspherical objects. Although the ellipsoidal mass is systematically larger, this is less than 10 per cent for most of the haloes. However, even this small difference in mass corresponds to a significant difference in shape. We quantify these effects also on the initial mass and deformation tensors, on which most models of triaxial collapse are based.  By studying the properties of protohaloes in the initial conditions, we find that models in which protohaloes are identified in Lagrangian space by three positive eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are tenable only at the masses well above M*. The overdensity $\delta$ within almost any protohalo is larger than the critical value associated with spherical collapse (increasing as mass decreases); this is in good qualitative agreement with models which identify haloes requiring that collapse has occurred along all three principal axes, each axis having turned around from the universal expansion at a different time. The distributions of initial values are in agreement with the simplest predictions associated with ellipsoidal collapse, assuming initially spherical protohaloes, collapsed around random positions which were sufficiently overdense.  However, most protohaloes are not spherical and departures from sphericity increase as protohalo mass decreases. The mass and deformation tensors are well aligned, in agreement with the fundamental assumption of ellipsoidal collapse, and with models which identify haloes with peaks in the initial density fluctuation field. But the direction of maximum initial compression coincides with the direction of what is initially the longest axis, contrary to what the peaks model predicts. By the final time, it is the shortest axis of the final object which tends to be aligned with the direction of initial maximal compression: the alignment changes during the evolution.},

A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10-30per cent at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our `Hubble volume' simulations of $\tau$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of `typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

abstract = {We present DisPerSE, a novel approach to the coherent multi-scale identification of all types of astrophysical structures, and in particular the filaments, in the large scale distribution of matter in the Universe. This method and corresponding piece of software allows a genuinely scale free and parameter free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the DTFE density computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing of the density field is required. The idea is based on recent advances in distinct sub-domains of computational topology, which allows a rigorous application of topological principles to astrophysical data sets, taking into account uncertainties and Poisson noise. Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of robustness with respect to noise (defined as a "number of sigmas") and the algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters, filaments, walls and voids; filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling along the edges of walls bounding the voids. The method is also interesting as it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics, without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale. In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D simulated and observed data sets to the companion paper.},

abstract = {A new numerical technique to identify the cosmic web is proposed. It is based on locating multi-stream flows, i.e. the places where the velocity field is multi-valued. The method is local in Eulerian space, simple and computaionally efficient. This technique uses the velocities of particles and thus takes into account the dynamical information. This is in contrast with the majority of standard methods that use the coordinates of particles only. Two quantities are computed in every mesh cell: the mean and variance of the velocity field. In the cells where the velocity is single-valued the variance must be equal to zero exactly, therefore the cells with non-zero variance are identified as multi-stream flows. The technique has been tested in a N-body simulation of the $\backslash$L CDM model. The preliminary analysis has shown that numerical noise does not pose a significant problem. The web identified by the new method has been compared with the web identified by the standard technique using only the particle coordinates. The comparison has shown overall similarity of two webs as expected, however they by no means are identical. For example, the isocontours of the corresponding fields have significantly different shapes and some density peaks of similar heights exhibit significant differences in the velocity variance and vice versa. This suggest that the density and velocity variance have a significant degree of independence. The shape of the two-dimensional pdf of density and velocity variance confirms this proposition. Thus, we conclude that the dynamical information probed by this technique introduces an additional dimension into analysis of the web.},

abstract = {A dynamical classification of the cosmic web is proposed. The large scale environment is classified into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor, i.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential, on a grid. The classification is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold, lambda{\_}th at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The collection of neighboring grid points, friends-of-friends, of the same web attribute constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as web objects. A simple dynamical consideration suggests that lambda{\_}th should be approximately unity, upon an appropriate scaling of the deformation tensor. The algorithm has been applied and tested against a suite of (dark matter only) cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions on lambda{\_}th and on the resolution has been calculated for the four web types. Also, the percolation properties of voids and filaments have been studied. Our main findings are: (a) Already at lambda{\_}th = 0.1 the resulting web classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (b) Between 0.2 {\textless} lambda{\_}th {\textless} 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of interconected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for lambda{\_}th as the parameter that defines the cosmic web. (c) The dynamical nature of the suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating environmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular the semi-analytical ones.},

abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10{\%} in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold dark matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Omega b/ Omega 0 {\textgreater}{\~{}} Omega 0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter Gamma .},

abstract = {The lecture notes describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator for Cosmic Web analysis. The high sensitivity of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations to the local point distribution is used to obtain estimates of density and related quantities. The adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of Delaunay tessellations are utilized for interpolation to continuous volume-covering density and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry preserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its hierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and structure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and background of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural Neighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques. This is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on spatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its performance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological applications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body simulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's performance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of the velocity flow in the Local Universe (implied by PSCz) illustrate its promise for probing the dynamics of cosmic structure. The Watershed Void Finder (Platen et al. 2007), for the study of voids, and Multiscale Morphology Filter (Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007), for identifying and analyzing weblike networks of filaments, sheets and clusters, are based upon DTFE density fields. We also mention SimpleX, a related random lattice radiative transfer formalism (Ritzerveld {\&} Icke 2006).},

abstract = {The initial conditions and relevant physics for the formation of the earliest galaxies are well specified in the concordance cosmology. Using ab initio cosmological Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamical calculations, we discuss how very massive stars start the process of cosmological reionization. The models include nonequilibrium primordial gas chemistry and cooling processes and accurate radiation transport in the case B approximation using adaptively ray-traced photon packages, retaining the time derivative in the transport equation. Supernova feedback is modeled by thermal explosions triggered at parsec scales. All calculations resolve the local Jeans length by at least 16 grid cells at all times and as such cover a spatial dynamic range of {\~{}}106. These first sources of reionization are highly intermittent and anisotropic and first photoionize the small-scale voids surrounding the halos they form in, rather than the dense filaments they are embedded in. As the merging objects form larger, dwarf-sized galaxies, the escape fraction of UV radiation decreases and the H II regions only break out on some sides of the galaxies, making them even more anisotropic. In three cases, SN blast waves induce star formation in overdense regions that were formed earlier from ionization front instabilities. These stars form tens of parsecs away from the center of their parent DM halo. Approximately five ionizing photons are needed per sustained ionization when star formation in 106 M☉ halos is dominant in the calculation. As the halos become larger than {\~{}}107 M☉, the ionizing photon escape fraction decreases, which in turn increases the number of photons per ionization to 15-50, in calculations with stellar feedback only. Radiative feedback decreases clumping factors by 25{\%} when compared to simulations without star formation and increases the average temperature of ionized gas to values between 3000 and 10,000 K.},

abstract = {Here we introduce the Delaunay Density Estimator Method. Its purpose is rendering a fully volume-covering reconstruction of a density field from a set of discrete data points sampling this field. Reconstructing density or intensity fields from a set of irregularly sampled data is a recurring key issue in operations on astronomical data sets, both in an observational context as well as in the context of numerical simulations. Our technique is based upon the stochastic geometric concept of the Delaunay tessellation generated by the point set. We shortly describe the method, and illustrate its virtues by means of an application to an N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation. The presented technique is a fully adaptive method: automatically it probes high density regions at maximum possible resolution, while low density regions are recovered as moderately varying regions devoid of the often irritating shot-noise effects. Of equal importance is its capability to sharply and undilutedly recover anisotropic density features like filaments and walls. The prominence of such features at a range of resolution levels within a hierarchical clustering scenario as the example of the standard CDM scenario is shown to be impressively recovered by our scheme.},

abstract = {We present the Smoothed Hessian Major Axis Filament Finder (SHMAFF), an algorithm that uses the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of the smoothed galaxy distribution to identify individual filamentary structures. Filaments are traced along the Hessian eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, and are stopped when the axis orientation changes more rapidly than a preset threshold. In both N-body simulations and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy redshift survey data, the resulting filament length distributions are approximately exponential. In the SDSS galaxy distribution, using smoothing lengths of 10 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 15 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc, we find filament lengths per unit volume of 1.9x10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} h{\^{}}2 Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} and 7.6x10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} h{\^{}}2 Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}, respectively. The filament width distributions, which are much more sensitive to non-linear growth, are also consistent between the real and mock galaxy distributions using a standard cosmology. In SDSS, we find mean filament widths of 5.5 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 8.4 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc on 10 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 15 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc smoothing scales, with standard deviations of 1.1 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc and 1.4 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc, respectively. Finally, the spatial distribution of filamentary structure in simulations is very similar between z=3 and z=0 on smoothing scales as large as 15 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc, suggesting that the outline of filamentary structure is already in place at high redshift.},

The distribution of galaxies in the sample, which contains 1100 galaxies in a 6 deg x 117 deg strip going through the Coma cluster, looks like a slice through the suds in the kitchen sink. It appears that the galaxies are on the surfaces of bubble-like structures with diameters of 25-50/h-Mpc. The largest bubble in the survey has a diameter comparable with the most recent estimates of the diameter of the void in Bootes. This topology poses serious challenges for current models for the formation of large-scale structure. The best available model for generating these structures is the explosive galaxy formation theory of Ostriker and Cowie (1981).},

abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

abstract = {The initial shear field, characterized by a primordial perturbation potential, plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures. Hence, considerable analytic work has been based on the joint distribution of its eigenvalues, associated with Gaussian statistics. In addition, directly related morphological quantities such as ellipticity or prolateness are essential tools in understanding the formation and structural properties of haloes, voids, sheets and filaments, their relation with the local environment, and the geometrical and dynamical classification of the cosmic web. To date, most analytic work has been focused on Doroshkevich's unconditional formulae for the eigenvalues of the linear tidal field, which neglect the fact that haloes (voids) may correspond to maxima (minima) of the density field. I present here new formulae for the constrained eigenvalues of the initial shear field associated with Gaussian statistics, which include the fact that those eigenvalues are related to regions where the source of the displacement is positive (negative): this is achieved by requiring the Hessian matrix of the displacement field to be positive (negative) definite. The new conditional formulae naturally reduce to Doroshkevich's unconditional relations, in the limit of no correlation between the potential and the density fields. As a direct application, I derive the individual conditional distributions of eigenvalues and point out the connection with previous literature. Finally, I outline other possible theoretically or observationally oriented uses, ranging from studies of halo and void triaxial formation, development of structure-finding algorithms for the morphology and topology of the cosmic web, to an accurate mapping of the gravitational potential environment of galaxies from current and future generation galaxy redshift surveys.},

In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D simulated and observed data sets to the companion paper.},

abstract = {We present the first and so far the only simulations to follow the fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic $\Lambda$ cold dark matter initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these methods to the six Milky Way mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from the halo centre, a typical point intersects about 1014 streams with a very broad range of individual densities; the ˜106 most-massive streams contribute about half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most-massive fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1 per cent of the total signal. Dark matter particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the big bang, with a 5-95 per cent range of 50-500. Such caustic counts are a measure of the total amount of dynamical mixing and are very robustly determined by our technique. The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a negligible boost ({\textless}0.1 per cent) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate. The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10 per cent. Thus, fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the detectability of the dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories or indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most-massive local fine-grained streams because of their extreme localization in the energy-momentum space.},

abstract = {Although coherent large-scale structures such as filaments and walls are apparent to the eye in galaxy redshift surveys, they have so far proven difficult to characterize with computer algorithms. This paper presents a procedure that uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of the galaxy density field to characterize the morphology of large-scale structure. By analysing the smoothed density field and its Hessian matrix, we can determine the types of structure - walls, filaments, or clumps - that dominate the large-scale distribution of galaxies as a function of scale. We have run the algorithm on mock galaxy distributions in a LCDM cosmological N-body simulation and the observed galaxy distributions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The morphology of structure is similar between the two catalogues, both being filament-dominated on 10-20 h -1 Mpc smoothing scales and clump-dominated on 5 h -1 Mpc scales. There is evidence for walls in both distributions, but walls are not the dominant structures on scales smaller than {\~{}}25 h -1 Mpc. Analysis of the simulation suggests that, on a given comoving smoothing scale, structures evolve with time from walls to filaments to clumps, where those found on smaller smoothing scales are further in this progression at a given time.},

abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began observations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and eBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS. This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all SDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes publicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to targeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected objects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the APOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously included and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For the SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with DR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and format of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to the important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data reduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data, tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from the planned {\~{}}6-year operations of SDSS-IV.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure of the matter distribution in the Universe due to the action of the gravitational instability -- the cosmic web -- is complicated by lack of direct analytic access to the nonlinear domain of structure formation. Here, we suggest and apply a novel tessellation method designed for cold dark matter (CDM) N-body cosmological simulations. The method is based on the fact that the initial CDM state can be described by a 3-D manifold (in a 6-D phase space) that remains continuous under evolution. Our technique uses the full phase space information and has no free parameters; it can be used to compute multi-stream and density fields, the main focus of this paper. Using a large-box LCDM simulation we carry out a variety of initial analyses with the technique. These include studying the correlation between multi-streaming and density, the identification of structures such as Zel'dovich pancakes and voids, and statistical measurements of quantities such as the volume fraction as a function of the number of streams -- where we find a remarkable scaling relation. Cosmological implications are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {It is shown that compact bodies project out strands of concentrated dark matter filaments henceforth simply called hairs. These hairs are a consequence of the fine-grained stream structure of dark matter halos, and as such constitute a new physical prediction of {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. Using both an analytical model of planetary density and numerical simulations utilizing the Fast Accurate Integrand Renormalization (FAIR) algorithm (a fast geodesics calculator described below) with realistic planetary density inputs, dark matter streams moving through a compact body are shown to produce hugely magnified dark matter densities along the stream velocity axis going through the center of the body. Typical hair density enhancements are {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$} for Earth and {\$}10{\^{}}8{\$} for Jupiter. The largest enhancements occur for particles streaming through the core of the body that mostly focus at a single point called the root of the hair. For the Earth, the root is located at about {\$}10{\^{}}6{\$}{\~{}}km from the planetary center with a density enhancement of around {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} while for a gas giant like Jupiter, the root is located at around {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}5{\}}{\$}{\~{}}km with a enhancement of around {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {The skeleton formalism, which aims at extracting and quantifying the filamentary structure of our Universe, is generalized to 3D density fields. A numerical method for computing a local approximation of the skeleton is presented and validated here on Gaussian random fields. It involves solving equation , where ∇$\rho$ and are the gradient and Hessian matrix of the field. This method traces well the filamentary structure in 3D fields such as those produced by numerical simulations of the dark matter distribution on large scales, and is insensitive to monotonic biasing. Two of its characteristics, namely its length and differential length, are analysed for Gaussian random fields. Its differential length per unit normalized density contrast scales like the probability distribution function of the underlying density contrast times the total length times a quadratic Edgeworth correction involving the square of the spectral parameter. The total length-scales like the inverse square smoothing length, with a scaling factor given by 0.21 (5.28 + n) where n is the power index of the underlying field. This dependency implies that the total length can be used to constrain the shape of the underlying power spectrum, hence the cosmology. Possible applications of the skeleton to galaxy formation and cosmology are discussed. As an illustration, the orientation of the spin of dark haloes and the orientation of the flow near the skeleton is computed for cosmological dark matter simulations. The flow is laminar along the filaments, while spins of dark haloes within 500 kpc of the skeleton are preferentially orthogonal to the direction of the flow at a level of 25 per cent.},

We use ORIGAMI to determine the cosmic web morphology of each dark matter particle in a suite of cosmological {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, which explicitly calculates whether a particle has crossed paths with others along multiple sets of axes and does not depend on a parameter or smoothing scale. The theoretical picture of voids is that of expanding underdensities with borders defined by shell-crossing. We find instead that locally underdense single-stream regions are not bounded on all sides by multi-stream regions, thus they percolate, filling the simulation volume; we show that the set of multi-stream particles also percolates. This percolation persists to high resolution, where the mass fraction of single-stream voids is low, because the volume fraction remains high; we speculate on the fraction of collapsed mass in the continuum limit of infinite resolution. By introducing a volume threshold parameter to define underdense void "cores", we create a catalog of ORIGAMI voids which consist entirely of single-stream particles and measure their percolation properties, volume functions, and average densities.},

abstract = {The existence of critical points for the peculiar velocity field is a natural feature of the correlated vector field. These points appear in contact zones of the velocity domains with different orientation of the averaged velocity vector. At the same time peculiar velocities are the cause of the scatter of the Hubble expansion rate. We propose that a more precise determination of the Hubble constant can be made by restricting analysis to subsample of observational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the peculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On large-scales the critical points where the first derivative of the gravitational potential vanishes can be easily identified using the density field and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational potential. We use high- resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions are stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially minimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of vanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging indiscriminately using the full data sets as is the common approach. This could help to reconcile the CMB-measured value of the Hubble constant with that obtained from the local measurements.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter halo properties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends, spherical-overdensity and phase-space-based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allow halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe.  All the halo-finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo, and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Through a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase-space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high-resolution cosmological volume, we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity and peak of the rotation curve).  We further suggest to utilize the peak of the rotation curve, vmax, as a proxy for mass, given the arbitrariness in defining a proper halo edge. Airport code for Madrid, Spain},

@article{Libeskind2013,
abstract = {The alignment of DM halos and the surrounding large scale structure (LSS) is examined in the context of the cosmic web. Halo spin, shape and the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the LSS using the eigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1 Mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. Knots, filaments, sheets and voids are associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principal directions simultaneously. Each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e. knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at the halo's position. The full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to be substantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that the observed velocity shear is significantly biased. We find that larger mass haloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansion or collapse is more spherical. A correlation is found between the halo's shape and the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis of the halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsing eigenvector. This correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocity shear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. A similar result is found for the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. It has been shown that high mass haloes exhibit a spin flip with rpespect to the LSS: we find the mass at which this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggested previously. Although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit an alignment with the LSS, providing a possible insight into the highly correlated co-rotation of the Milky Way's satellite system. The present study suggests that the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studying the directional properties of the non-linear LSS and of halos and galaxies.},

This is a multiscale and automatic morphological analysis tool that identifies all the cosmic structures in a scale free way, without preference for a certain size or shape. We develop the NEXUS method to incorporate the density, tidal field, velocity divergence and velocity shear as tracers of the cosmic web. We also present the NEXUS+ procedure which, taking advantage of a novel filtering of the density in logarithmic space, is very successful at identifying the filament and wall environments in a robust and natural way.  To assess the algorithms we apply them to an N-body simulation. We find that all methods correctly identify the most prominent filaments and walls, while there are differences in the detection of the more tenuous structures. In general, the structures traced by the density and tidal fields are clumpier and more rugged than those present in the velocity divergence and velocity shear fields. We find that the NEXUS+ method captures much better the filamentary and wall networks and is successful in detecting even the fainter structures. We also confirm the efficiency of our methods by examining the dark matter particle and halo distributions.},

@article{Giocoli2010a,
abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying the substructure within simulated dark matter haloes. The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et al. (2004) and Giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group of self-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of the host halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite). However, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellite haloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise to sub-subhaloes, etc. Our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels of this hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of all substructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). On average, haloes which formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure and to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide quantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very different from that of Gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo mass function per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. This universality extends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a given mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and substructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple parametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo masses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which should be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo substructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. Finally, we discuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise from different definitions of (host) halo mass.},

abstract = {Resolving numerically Vlasov-Poisson equations for initially cold systems can be reduced to following the evolution of a three-dimensional sheet evolving in six-dimensional phase-space. We describe a public parallel numerical algorithm consisting in representing the phase-space sheet with a conforming, self-adaptive simplicial tessellation of which the vertices follow the Lagrangian equations of motion. The algorithm is implemented both in six- and four-dimensional phase-space. Refinement of the tessellation mesh is performed using the bisection method and a local representation of the phase-space sheet at second order relying on additional tracers created when needed at runtime. In order to preserve in the best way the Hamiltonian nature of the system, refinement is anisotropic and constrained by measurements of local Poincar$\backslash$'e invariants. Resolution of Poisson equation is performed using the fast Fourier method on a regular rectangular grid, similarly to particle in cells codes. To compute the density projected onto this grid, the intersection of the tessellation and the grid is calculated using the method of Franklin and Kankanhalli (1993) generalised to linear order. As preliminary tests of the code, we study in four dimensional phase-space the evolution of an initially small patch in a chaotic potential and the cosmological collapse of a fluctuation composed of two sinusoidal waves. We also perform a "warm" dark matter simulation in six-dimensional phase-space that we use to check the parallel scaling of the code.},

This study demonstrates that cultural differences exist between scientific fields and also supports existing policy recommendations that encourage the creation of organizations and partnerships at university level to allow scientists to more easily participate in activities with broader impacts. Emphasizing broader impacts activities may also attract a more diverse scientific workforce, as many individuals do not pursue science because of a perceived lack of impact.},

abstract = {While various codes exist to systematically and robustly find haloes and subhaloes in cosmological simulations, this is the first work to introduce and rigorously test codes that find tidal debris (streams and other unbound substructure) in fully cosmological simulations of structure formation. We use one tracking and three non-tracking codes to identify substructure (bound and unbound) in a Milky Way type simulation from the Aquarius suite and post-process their output with a common pipeline to determine the properties of these substructures in a uniform way. By using output from a fully cosmological simulation, we also take a step beyond previous studies of tidal debris that have used simple toy models. We find that both tracking and non-tracking codes agree well on the identification of subhaloes and more importantly, the unbound tidal features associated with them. The distributions of basic properties of the total substructure distribution (mass, velocity dispersion, position) are recovered with a scatter of ˜20 per cent. Using the tracking code as our reference, we show that the non-tracking codes identify complex tidal debris with purities of ˜40 per cent. Analysing the results of the substructure finders, we find that the general distribution of substructures differ significantly from the distribution of bound subhaloes. Most importantly, both bound and unbound substructures together constitute ˜18 per cent of the host halo mass, which is a factor of ˜2 higher than the fraction in self-bound subhaloes. However, this result is restricted by the remaining challenge to cleanly define when an unbound structure has become part of the host halo. Nevertheless, the more general substructure distribution provides a more complete picture of a halo's accretion history.},

The Zeldovich approximation is used to model the backbone of the cosmic web in terms of its singularity structure. The description by Arnold et al. (1982) in terms of catastrophe theory forms the basis of our analysis. This two-dimensional analysis involves a profound assessment of the Lagrangian and Eulerian projections of the gravitationally evolving four-dimensional phase-space manifold. It involves the identification of the complete family of singularity classes, and the corresponding caustics that we see emerging as structure in Eulerian space evolves. In particular, as it is instrumental in outlining the spatial network of the cosmic web, we investigate the nature of spatial connections between these singularities. The major finding of our study is that all singularities are located on a set of lines in Lagrangian space. All dynamical processes related to the caustics are concentrated near these lines. We demonstrate and discuss extensively how all 2D singularities are to be found on these lines. When mapping this spatial pattern of lines to Eulerian space, we find a growing connectedness between initially disjoint lines, resulting in a percolating network. In other words, the lines form the blueprint for the global geometric evolution of the cosmic web.},

abstract = {We consider the motion of a spinning relativistic particle in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, to first order in the external field, but to an arbitrary order in spin. The noncovariant spin formalism is crucial for the correct description of the influence of the spin on the particle trajectory. We show that the true coordinate of a relativistic spinning particle is its naive, common coordinate {\$}\backslashr{\$}. Concrete calculations are performed up to second order in spin included. A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

The method, originally developed for blood vessels detection in medical images, can also be used in other areas, where finding line-like structures in the image is required. Theoretical background, advantages and disadvantages of the method are described. Possible modifications required to allow the method to detect structures of different character (airway tree) are mentioned. An implementation of the method was tested on synthetic images containing airway-like structures as well as on real medical images from chest CT scan. Results show that the method in general can be used to airway detection in 3D medical images, however it requires improvements and some adaptation to this specific purpose.},

This yields a galaxy map that can be compared to that of the Lick data. In the model there are 7.5 million galaxies at a mean space density of 0.065 h-cubed per Mpc (H = 100 h km/s per Mpc), and 386,000 galaxies are visible at apparent magnitudes of no more than 18.9 and galactic latitudes of at least 40 deg. By adjusting parameters in the model within the limits allowed by the correlation functions to fourth order, a galaxy map with a visual appearance that seems a reasonable first approximation to that of the Lick data is obtained.},

abstract = {We present the first and so far the only simulations to follow the fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic $\Lambda$ cold dark matter initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these methods to the six Milky Way mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from the halo centre, a typical point intersects about 1014 streams with a very broad range of individual densities; the ˜106 most-massive streams contribute about half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most-massive fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1 per cent of the total signal. Dark matter particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the big bang, with a 5-95 per cent range of 50-500. Such caustic counts are a measure of the total amount of dynamical mixing and are very robustly determined by our technique. The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a negligible boost ({\textless}0.1 per cent) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate. The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10 per cent. Thus, fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the detectability of the dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories or indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most-massive local fine-grained streams because of their extreme localization in the energy-momentum space.},

abstract = {Modern N-body cosmological simulations contain billions ({\$}10{\^{}}9{\$}) of dark matter particles. These simulations require hundreds to thousands of gigabytes of memory, and employ hundreds to tens of thousands of processing cores on many compute nodes. In order to study the distribution of dark matter in a cosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halo finder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in the simulation. The resources required for halo finding are similar to the requirements for the simulation itself. In particular, simulations have become too extensive to use commonly-employed halo finders, such that the computational requirements to identify halos must now be spread across multiple nodes and cores. Here we present a scalable-parallel halo finding method called Parallel HOP for large-scale cosmological simulation data. Based on the halo finder HOP, it utilizes MPI and domain decomposition to distribute the halo finding workload across multiple compute nodes, enabling analysis of much larger datasets than is possible with the strictly serial or previous parallel implementations of HOP. We provide a reference implementation of this method as a part of the toolkit yt, an analysis toolkit for Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data that includes complementary analysis modules. Additionally, we discuss a suite of benchmarks that demonstrate that this method scales well up to several hundred tasks and datasets in excess of {\$}2000{\^{}}3{\$} particles. The Parallel HOP method and our implementation can be readily applied to any kind of N-body simulation data and is therefore widely applicable.},

Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

abstract = {Contrary to the common view voids have very complex internal structure and dynamics. Here we show how the hierarchy of structures in the density field inside voids is reflected by a similar hierarchy of structures in the velocity field. Voids defined by dense filaments and clusters can de described as simple expanding domains with coherent flows everywhere except at their boundaries. At scales smaller that the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding sub-domains corresponding to sub- voids. These sub-domains break into even smaller sub-sub domains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of locally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity field responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining the sub voids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale components of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids but they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them cosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations allowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids also act like time machines by "freezing" the development of the medium-scale density fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of structures seen connecting proto galaxies in computer simulations. As a result of this freezing haloes in voids can remain "connected" to this tenuous web until the present time. This may have an important effect in the formation and evolution of galaxies in voids by providing an efficient gas accretion mechanism via coherent low-velocity streams that can keep a steady inflow of matter for extended periods of time.},

abstract = {The primordial velocity dispersion of dark matter is small compared to the velocities attained during structure formation. The initial density distribution is close to uniform, and it occupies an initial sheet in phase space that is single valued in velocity space. Because of gravitational forces, this 3D manifold evolves in phase space without ever tearing, conserving phase-space volume and preserving the connectivity of nearby points. N-body simulations already follow the motion of this sheet in phase space. This fact can be used to extract full fine-grained phase-space structure information from existing cosmological N-body simulations. Particles are considered as the vertices of an unstructured 3D mesh moving in 6D phase space. On this mesh, mass density and momentum are uniquely defined. We show how to obtain the space density of the fluid, detect caustics and count the number of streams as well as their individual contributions to any point in configuration space. We calculate the bulk velocity, local velocity dispersions and densities from the sheet - all without averaging over control volumes. This gives a wealth of new information about dark matter fluid flow which had previously been thought of as inaccessible to N-body simulations. We outline how this mapping may be used to create new accurate collisionless fluid simulation codes that may be able to overcome the sparse sampling and unphysical two-body effects that plague current N-body techniques.},

abstract = {We report here the first systematic study of the supercluster-void network in the LCDM concordance cosmology in which voids and superclusters are treated on an equal footing. Superclusters are defined as individual members of an over-dense excursion set and voids are defined as individual members of a complementary under-dense excursion set at the same density threshold. We determine the geometric, topological and morphological properties of the cosmic web at a large set of density levels by computing Minkowski functionals for every supercluster and void using SURFGEN. The properties of the largest (percolating) supercluster and the complementary void are found to be very different from properties of individual superclusters and voids. Individual superclusters totally occupy no more than about 5{\%} of the total volume and contain no more than 20{\%} of mass if the largest supercluster is excluded. Likewise, individual voids totally occupy no more than 14{\%} of volume and contain no more than 4{\%} of mass if the largest void is excluded. Although superclusters are more massive and voids are more voluminous the difference in maximum volumes is not greater than by an order of magnitude. The genus value of individual superclusters can be 5 while the genus of individual voids can reach 40, implying significant amount of substructure in superclusters and especially in voids. One of our main results is that large voids, as defined through the density field (read dark matter distribution) can be distinctly non-spherical.},

abstract = {We report results from simulations of neutralino dark matter ({\$}\backslashchi{\$}DM) haloes. We follow them from their emergence at one earth mass to a final mass of a few percent solar. We show that the density profiles of the first haloes are well described by a {\$}\backslashsim r{\^{}}{\{}-1.5{\}}{\$} power-law. As haloes grow in mass, their density profiles evolve significantly. In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on average {\$}\backslashsim r{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. However, the profile of individual haloes can show non-monotonic density slopes, and be shallower than {\$}-1{\$} in some cases. We investigate the transformation of cuspy power-law profiles using a series of non-cosmological simulations of equal-mass mergers. Contrary to previous findings, we observe that temporal variations in the gravitational potential caused by mergers lead to a shallowing of the inner profile, an effect which is stronger for shallower initial profiles and for mergers that involve a higher number of systems. Depending on the merger details, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their inner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the initial profile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of {\$}-1{\$} (such as NFW or Hernquist profiles). This offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of NFW-like profiles in {\$}\backslashchi{\$}DM simulations. After their initial collapse, {\$}\backslashchi{\$}DM haloes suffer copious major mergers, which progressively shallows the profile. However, once an NFW-like profile is established, it appears stable against subsequent merging. This suggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a combination of (1) the physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2) their early merger history, which are both set by the properties of the dark matter particle, as well as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to perturbations.},

The former simulations model hierarchical clustering from white noise initial conditions while the latter represent the growth of structure in the pancake model. The Poisson simulations form tight clusters with no large-scale coherence whereas the pancake simulations produce long chains. The correlation function in the Poisson simulation grows in a self-similar fashion and is not well fitted by a power law, whereas in the pancake models it has roughly power law behavior over the range 100-1 with a slope that increases with time. The pancake models fit the filamentary structure of the observed galaxy distribution considerably better than the Poisson models.},

abstract = {We introduce a multiscale topological description of the Megaparsec weblike cosmic matter distribution. Betti numbers and topological persistence offer a powerful means of describing the rich connectivity structure of the cosmic web and of its multiscale arrangement of matter and galaxies. Emanating from algebraic topology and Morse theory, Betti numbers and persistence diagrams represent an extension and deepening of the cosmologically familiar topological genus measure, and the related geometric Minkowski functionals. In addition to a description of the mathematical background, this study presents the computational procedure for computing Betti numbers and persistence diagrams for density field filtrations. The field may be computed starting from a discrete spatial distribution of galaxies or simulation particles. The main emphasis of this study concerns an extensive and systematic exploration of the imprint of different weblike morphologies and different levels of multiscale clustering in the corresponding computed Betti numbers and persistence diagrams. To this end, we use Voronoi clustering models as templates for a rich variety of weblike configurations, and the fractal-like Soneira-Peebles models exemplify a range of multiscale configurations. We have identified the clear imprint of cluster nodes, filaments, walls, and voids in persistence diagrams, along with that of the nested hierarchy of structures in multiscale point distributions. We conclude by outlining the potential of persistent topology for understanding the connectivity structure of the cosmic web, in large simulations of cosmic structure formation and in the challenging context of the observed galaxy distribution in large galaxy surveys.},

abstract = {We present the relation between the genus in cosmology and the Betti numbers for excursion sets of three- and two-dimensional smooth Gaussian random fields, and numerically investigate the Betti numbers as a function of threshold level. Betti numbers are topological invariants of figures that can be used to distinguish topological spaces. In the case of the excursion sets of a three-dimensional field there are three possibly non-zero Betti numbers; {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}0{\$} is the number of connected regions, {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}1{\$} is the number of circular holes, and {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}2{\$} is the number of three-dimensional voids. Their sum with alternating signs is the genus of the surface of excursion regions. It is found that each Betti number has a dominant contribution to the genus in a specific threshold range. {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}0{\$} dominates the high-threshold part of the genus curve measuring the abundance of high density regions (clusters). {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}1{\$} dominates the genus near the median thresholds which measures the topology of negatively curved iso-density surfaces, and {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}2{\$} corresponds to the low-threshold part measuring the void abundance. We average the Betti number curves (the Betti numbers as a function of the threshold level) over many realizations of Gaussian fields and find that both the amplitude and shape of the Betti number curves depend on the slope of the power spectrum {\$}n{\$} in such a way that their shape becomes broader and their amplitude drops less steeply than the genus as {\$}n{\$} decreases. This behaviour contrasts with the fact that the shape of the genus curve is fixed for all Gaussian fields regardless of the power spectrum. Even though the Gaussian Betti number curves should be calculated for each given power spectrum, we propose to use the Betti numbers for better specification of the topology of large scale structures in the universe.},

abstract = {Understanding of the observed structure in the universe can be reached only in the theoretical framework of dark matter. N-body simulations are indispensable for the analysis of the formation and evolution of the dark matter web. Two primary fields - density and velocity fields - are used in most of studies. However dark matter provides two additional fields which are unique for collisionless media only. These are the multi- stream field in Eulerian space and flip-flop field in Lagrangian space. The flip-flop field represents the number of sign reversals of an elementary volume of each collisionless fluid element. This field can be estimated by counting the sign reversals of the Jacobian at each particle at every time step of the simulation. The Jacobian is evaluated by numerical differentiation of the Lagrangian submanifold, i.e., the three-dimensional dark matter sheet in the six-dimensional space formed by three Lagrangian and three Eulerian coordinates. We present the results of the statistical study of the evolution of the flip-flop field from z = 50 to the present time z = 0. A number of statistical characteristics show that the pattern of the flip-flop field remains remarkably stable from z = 30 to the present time. As a result the flip-flop field evaluated at z = 0 stores a wealth of information about the dynamical history of the dark matter web. In particular one of the most intriguing properties of the flip-flop is a unique capability to preserve the information about the merging history of dark matter haloes.},

abstract = {Cosmology is entering an era of percent level precision due to current large observational surveys. This precision in observation is now demanding more accuracy from numerical methods and cosmological simulations. In this paper, we study the accuracy of N-body numerical simulations and their dependence on changes in the initial conditions and in the simulation algorithms. For this purpose, we use a series of cosmological N-body simulations with varying initial conditions. We test the influence of the initial conditions, namely the pre-initial configuration (preIC), the order of the Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT), and the initial redshift (zini), on the statistics associated with the large scale structures of the universe such as the halo mass function, the density power spectrum, and the maximal extent of the large scale structures. We find that glass or grid pre-initial conditions give similar results at z 2. However, the initial excess of power in the glass initial conditions yields a subtle difference in the power spectra and the mass function at high redshifts. The LPT order used to generate the initial conditions of the simulations is found to play a crucial role. First-order LPT (1LPT) simulations underestimate the number of massive haloes with respect to second-order (2LPT) ones, typically by 2{\%} at 1014h-1M {\^{a}}{\v{S}}™ for an initial redshift of 23, and the small-scale power with an underestimation of 6{\%} near the Nyquist frequency for zini=23. Larger underestimations are observed for lower starting redshifts. Moreover, at higher redshifts, the high-mass end of the mass function is significantly underestimated in 1LPT simulations. On the other hand, when the LPT order is fixed, the starting redshift has a systematic impact on the low-mass end of the halo mass function. Lower starting redshifts yield more low-mass haloes. Finally, we compare two N-body codes, Gadget-3 and GOTPM, and find 8{\%} differences in the power spectrum at small scales and in the low-mass end of the halo mass function.},

In the model, filaments generally spin when they form, and the halo spins if and only if there is some rotation in filaments. This is the simplest-possible fully three-dimensional halo collapse in the 'origami approximation,' in which voids are irrotational, and the dark-matter sheet out of which dark-matter structures form is allowed to fold in position-velocity phase space, but not stretch (i.e., it cannot vary in density along a stream). Up to an overall scaling, the four filament directions, and only three other quantities, such as filament spins, suffice to determine all of the collapse's properties: the shape, mass, and spin of the halo; the densities per unit length and spins of all filaments; and masses per unit area of the walls. If the filaments are arranged regular-tetrahedrally, filament properties obey simple laws, reminiscent of angular-momentum conservation. The model may be most useful in understanding spin correlations between neighboring galaxies joined by filaments; these correlations would give intrinsic alignments between galaxies, essential to understand for accurate cosmological weak-lensing measurements.},
